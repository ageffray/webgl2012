\par }{\b\fs32\cf13\cgrid0 Introduction\tab 
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 
\par \tab Mysterious guardian of a sacred grove, wise counselor to monarchs, cunning master of many shapes, friend of animals, and terrible defender of unspoiled Nature: This is the druid of the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons\'ae game.
\par \tab Although the priests of the Celtic tribes of Western Europe in the time of Rome called themselves druids, the druids of the AD&D\'ae
 game are not Celtic priests, nor do they practice the bloody rites that made the ancient druids infamous in the eyes of Rome. Rather, these druids more closely resemble creatures of Vic
torian romance and modern fantasy, Merlin figures who revere Nature and wield power over plants, animals, the weather, and the elements.
\par \tab This book is designed to illuminate the many abilities of druids and show how the neutral and "unaligned" druid can be
st adventure with a party of predominantly good characters. It also reveals what a druid does when not adventuring and demonstrates how a druid can become the center of a new and exciting campaign.
\par \tab }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 The Complete Druid's Handbook}{\fs24\cgrid0  adds numerous options to the druid class from the }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 Player's Handbook}{\fs24\cgrid0 
, including druids from regions other than the woodlands, and introduces many specialized druid kits. Also included are new spells and magical items, as well as rules for a druid's sacred grove.
\par \tab Those using this book with the AD&D Original Edition game should know that page references correspond with the AD&D 2nd Edition}{\i\fs24\cgrid0  Player's Handbook}{\fs24\cgrid0  }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 (PH)}{\fs24\cgrid0  and }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 Dungeon Master
\'ae Guide (DMG).}{\fs24\cgrid0  The original druid class appears here as an appendix, with some material from the AD&D Original Edition reference book }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 Unearthed Arcana.}{\fs24\cgrid0 
\par }{\b\fs32\cf13\cgrid0 
\par Chapter 1: Druid Characters\tab 
\par 
\par \tab }{\fs24\cgrid0 The traditional druid is a guardian of the woodlands. Nature, however, is vast and diverse; thus the druids detailed in this book might live their lives protecting jungle rain for
ests, arctic tundra, or even the subterranean Underdark. As a result, several distinct branches of druid are presented here, each essentially a new subclass built around the basic concept of the druid class. As a player, choose your druidic branch right a
fter deciding to play a druid character.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf13\cgrid0 Druidic Organization
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 
\par \tab The basic druid as described in the }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 PH }{\fs24\cgrid0 is referred to here as the "forest druid." The names of the other branches reflect their geographic specialty: arctic druids, desert druids, and so on.
\par \tab 
Members of all the branches of the druidic order have the same alignment--true neutral--and worship Nature. They share one ethos and owe at least nominal allegiance to the world's Grand Druid. But, as befits the infinite diversity of Nature, every branch 
differs in details and approach to its mission. The granted powers and spells that Nature finds appropriate for a druid in one region are often inappropriate for a druid from a very different climate and terrain.
\par \tab For instance, while the forest druids described in the }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 PH}{\fs24\cgrid0 
 have major access to the Plant sphere of priest spells, the branch of desert druids has only minor access to that sphere, reflecting the less abundant plant life in the desert. Similarly, while a forest druid's ability to pass through overgr
owth is very useful in the woods, it has much less utility for a desert druid. Instead, the branch of desert druids has granted powers enabling them to survive in arid country.
\par \tab Some rivalry exists between the different branches of druids. On most worlds, 
the forest druids belong to the dominant branch. However, on a few worlds (such as one in the midst of an ice age) another branch might wield the most power. For more details on rivalry between branches, see Chapter 3: The Druidic Order.
\par \tab 
The Dungeon Master can restrict some branches to nonplayer characters (NPCs) or even prohibit them to suit the background or direction of a campaign. For example, the Dungeon Master (DM) might decide that the gray druids of the Underdark would make exciti
n
g adversaries for the characters. Since having player characters (PCs) as gray druids would water down the impact of the gray druids as foes, the DM can prohibit players from choosing that branch. Later in the campaign, after the party has encountered the
 gray druids, the DM might open the branch to players.
\par \tab Similarly, some druid branches simply may not seem very logical or useful in certain campaigns. A wise DM would discourage players from selecting the arctic branch for their druid characters in a campaign set in a jungle.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf13\cgrid0 The Essential Druid
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 
\par \tab Some characteristics and limitations apply to }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 all}{\fs24\cgrid0  branches of the druidic order. The following section expands on the rules for druid characters in the }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 PH}{\fs24\cgrid0  (pgs. 35B38).
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Alignment and Ethos}{\fs24\cgrid0 
\par \tab 
\par \tab All druids are of neutral alignment and share an ethos devoted to protecting the wilderness and maintaining natural cycles and a balance between good and evil (}{\i\fs24\cgrid0 PH}{\fs24\cgrid0 
, pgs. 37, 47). For a detailed discussion of the neutral alignment and the beliefs of druids, refer to Chapter 4: Role-playing Druids.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Experience and Hit Dice
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab All druids must use the druid column of Table 23: Priest Experience Levels (}{\i\fs24\cgrid0 PH}{\fs24\cgrid0 , p. 33). Druids, like other members of the priest group, use eight-sided Hit Dice (HD), gaining one die per level from 1st thro
ugh 9th level. After 9th level, druids receive an additional 2 hit points per level, but gain no special bonus for high Constitution.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Proficiencies and Crossovers
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab Druids gain proficiencies just like other priests (}{\i\fs24\cgrid0 PH}{\fs24\cgrid0 , p. 50), starting with two weapon and four nonweapon proficiencies.
\par \tab It is strongly recommended that you, the player, use the optional nonweapon proficiency rules when creating druid characters with this book. The various branches of druids (and the druid kits described later) make extensiv
e use of the nonweapon proficiency system to differentiate among types of druids.
\par \tab Note that druid nonweapon proficiencies come from the general, priest, and warrior groups. Druids have access to the warrior group (even though many other priests do not) be
cause it contains many of the proficiencies associated with outdoor skills the druid needs to operate in the wilderness.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Money and Equipment
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab Druids start with 3d6-10 gp, which they can use to purchase equipment. All but a few coins (less than 1 gp) must be spent prior to entering play.
\par \tab If using the optional druid kit rules described later in this book, both the initial money and the equipment allowed might vary depending on the kit.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Magical Items
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab Druids use all magical items norm
ally permitted to priests, with the exception of written items (books and scrolls) and those types of armor and weapons that are normally forbidden them. (The weapons and armor permitted to members of each branch and kit do vary, but they remain similar t
o those allowed to druids in the }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 PH}{\fs24\cgrid0 .)
\par \tab Thus, a druid who finds magical chain mail may not wear it, since druids must use only nonmetallic armor. Similarly, a druid cannot wield a magical mace, since maces are not among the permitted druidic arms.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 The Secret Language
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab All druids can speak a secret language in addition to other tongues they know. Using the optional proficiency system, the secret language does not require a proficiency slot.
\par 
\par }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 The secret language of the druids has its roots in British traditi
on. A language called Thari, derived from Celtic roots, apparently was spoken as a secret tongue throughout the British Isles by a small number of traveling folk such as tinkers and bards. It later was adopted by some Gypsy clans in addition to Romany, th
e
ir own Indic language. Thari may predate the Dark Ages, and some claim fluency in it even today. Certain researchers seeking the roots of Thari as a language distinct from Gaelic have linked its origins to both ancient Celtic craft guilds and to the histo
rical druids. If the DM wants to name the druids' secret language, Thari possesses some historical relevance.
\par \tab 
\par \tab }{\fs24\cgrid0 Not only can druids use the secret language to provide passwords, they can speak this private tongue when they wish to baffle nondruidic eavesdr
oppers. It is a precise tool for discussing Nature; a druid can say "dense, old-growth pine forest" in one word rather than a whole phrase.
\par \tab The secret language has a specialized and detailed vocabulary limited to dealing with Nature and natural events; be
yond this sphere, it is very basic. A druid could use the secret language to talk about the health of a person, animal, or plant; discuss the weather; or give detailed directions through the wilderness. The language also can describe druidic spells, cerem
o
nies, powers, and any natural and supernatural creatures known to the druids. However, it contains no words for sophisticated human emotions, for most tools or artifacts (beyond those used for hunting, farming, or fishing), or for weapons and armor (other
 than items druids use). The language also contains few words that refer to concepts peculiar to sentient beings, like }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 property, justice, theft,}{\fs24\cgrid0  or }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 war}{\fs24\cgrid0 
. Tense distinctions blur in this secret tongue; usually the concepts druids express bear a certain immediacy or timelessness.
\par \tab Finally, the secret language of the druids remains a purely spoken tongue. A few simple runes or marks (symbolizing }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 danger, safe water, safe trail}{\fs24\cgrid0 
, and so on) exist for marking paths and leaving messages, but the language cannot communicate actual sentences and complex ideas in writing.
\par \tab Here's an example of how the secret language works in practice. Suppose two druids are discussing a magical item and want to converse entirely in the secret language, using no words borrowed from other tongues. One druid wishes to say:
\par 
\par \tab This magical long sword was a gift to Melinda, wife to King Rupert, from Rupert's \tab court wizard Drufus. The mage gave it the power to throw lightning bolts. But then King Rupert grew jealous of Melinda. He had her execu
ted and took the blade for himself. After Rupert died, the sword was left buried in the dungeons under his castle.
\par 
\par In the secret language, the story might come out something like this:
\par 
\par \tab This magic scimitar was for the Tall Golden Female, mate of the Man-Leader, from the Wielder of Magic from the Vale of the White Eagles. He put the call lightning power in it. But the Man-Leader wanted it. He killed the Tall Golden Female and \tab 
took it for himself. He died. The scimitar stayed in the cave under his big stone man-den.
\par 
\par \tab See the difference? There's no word for }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 long sword}{\fs24\cgrid0 , so our druid has substituted "scimitar." (All druidic weapons have names.) The idea of a }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 gift}{\fs24\cgrid0  is described in more basic term
s. In addition, the concept of naming has no place in this Nature-oriented language; people and creatures are known by description, status, or place of origin.
\par \tab }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 Wizard}{\fs24\cgrid0  becomes the more generic "wielder of magic." }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 Lightning}{\fs24\cgrid0 , a natural phenomenon, has an equ
ivalent in the secret language. But the secret language cannot convey a human emotion such as Rupert's }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 jealousy}{\fs24\cgrid0 , so the druid has had to substitute less precise phrasing. Similarly, the private tongue does not cover}{
\i\fs24\cgrid0  execution }{\fs24\cgrid0 or }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 murder}{\fs24\cgrid0 , so the druid used the more generic "killed." Finally, no druidic term corresponds to }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 dungeon}{\fs24\cgrid0  or }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 castle}{\fs24\cgrid0 
, so the druid has had to use other words\emdash "cave under his big stone man-den"--to convey that image. Of course, a druid not worried about being overheard might mix the secret language and normal speech in a single sentence.
\par \tab The secret language helps bind the worldwide druidic order together. Druids from different circles (See Chapter 3: The Druidic Order) or branches all speak the same secret language. However, they may have 
developed their own regional accents or dialects. These could enable a listener to identify the region the druid comes from, or provide a clue to the speaker's branch.
\par \tab In a Spelljammer\'ae or Planescape\'ae campaign and through the use of certain spells and magical items, druids from different worlds can meet. The DM should decide whether their secret languages resemble each other enough to allow communication.

\par \tab Finally, the druid's secret language, while private, is not supernatural--theoretically, others can learn it. However, because the tongue provides druids with code phrases or passwords, they simply }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 will not}{\fs24\cgrid0 
 teach it to nondruids. The great druid of the region will punish any who break with this tradition.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Shapechanging
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab Characters belonging to almost a
ll druidic branches (discussed later in this chapter) can shapechange into various animal forms upon reaching 7th level. For more than the following guidelines, consult the description of a particular branch's granted powers.
\par \tab Normally, the druid can assume only a limited number of shapes each day, depending on the character's branch; the choice of branch usually restricts the types of forms the druid can assume.
\par \tab Shifting shape takes one round, during which the druid cannot take other actions. The druid ca
n remain in the new shape indefinitely--the duration of a form ends only when the druid turns back to the original shape or assumes another one. A druid can shift from one shape to another without returning to human form first.
\par \tab Upon assuming a new form, t
he druid heals 10% to 60% (1d6-10) of all damage. (Round fractions down.) For example, a druid who has suffered 15 points of damage rolls a 3 on a d6. Therefore, the character regains 30%-15 hp, or 4.5 hp. This value becomes 4 hit points after rounding.

\par \tab T
he animal form a druid assumes can vary from the size of a bullfrog or small bird to that of a black bear. Unless noted otherwise, the druid can assume only the form of a normal (real-world) animal in normal proportions. A druid in animal form takes on al
l the beast's physical characteristics movement rate, abilities, Armor Class (AC), number of attacks, and damage per attack. The druid retains original hit point and saving throw values.
\par \tab The druid's clothing and one item held in each hand also become part 
of the new body; these reappear when the druid resumes normal shape. Generally, a druid in animal form cannot use such items, but in particularly challenging campaigns, the DM may allow protective devices, such as a}{\i\fs24\cgrid0  ring of protection}{
\fs24\cgrid0 , to function normally.
\par \tab A shapechanged druid radiates strong Alteration magic.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Turning Undead
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab No druid has the granted power to turn undead. Such creatures are not of the living world--the only world that concerns druids--so members of this class have no control over them.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Higher-level Druids
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab The worldwide organization of the druids allows for the existence of only a limited number of 12th- or higher-level druids, assigning them special titles, servants, and responsibilities. Druids who gain enough experience to reach 1
2th level can advance only if they find a vacancy within the Order's ranks or wrest a position from another druid through the challenge. (See Chapter 3: The Druidic Order.)
\par \tab Only one 15th-level druid exists in any campaign world: the Grand Druid, chief of 
all druids in the world. The Grand Druid can come from any branch, though on many worlds this position requires a member of the usually dominant forest druids. A Grand Druid who retires and continues to gain experience can become a hierophant druid, of wh
ich a world can have any number.
\par \tab The rules for druids of 12th and higher levels described in the }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 PH}{\fs24\cgrid0 
 on pgs. 37-38 apply to all druidic branches. For more details on the hierarchy of druids and the special responsibilities of higher-level characters, see Chapter 3: The Druidic Order.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf13\cgrid0 Druidic Branches
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 
\par \tab Each branch within the druidic order operates, effectively, as a separate priest class under the standard druid rules. Here's how the pages that follow describe the characteristics of each branch:
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Minimum Ability Scores. }{\fs24\cgrid0 The druidic prime requisites of Wisdom 12 and Charisma 15, or slightly modified scores, serve as the minimum ability scores necessary for a character to choose a particular branch.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Races Allowed}{\fs24\cgrid0 . Standard (forest) druids are usually humans or half-elves, but members of other races can choose some druidic branches. (Details on these options appear in }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 The Complete Book of Humanoids
}{\fs24\cgrid0 .) A number in parenthesis shows the maximum level these characters normally reach; they can achieve higher levels only with high ability scores, as stated in the }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 DMG,}{\fs24\cgrid0  pgs. 14-15.
\par \tab 
\par \tab }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 The Complete Book of Humanoids}{\fs24\cgrid0  offers four new races for use as druid PCs: alaghi, centaurs, saurials, and swanmays. Other nonhumans can become druids, at the DM's option, though details o
n these characters should be carefully worked out within the guidelines of}{\i\fs24\cgrid0  The Complete Book of Humanoids}{\fs24\cgrid0 . Possible allowable races include:
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Dryads.}{\fs24\cgrid0  A dryad is quite shy and unable to travel far from her home tree. Unusual circumstances might allow a drya
d PC to become a druid and travel within a large forest using magical items that link her with her home tree, but it remains unlikely that the dryad will advance beyond 4th level in ability. DRAGON\'ae
 Magazine (#109, "Hooves and Green Hair") has suggested that half-dryads (born of a union of human male and dryad) might reach 7th level or higher. Dryads and half-dryads always become forest druids.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Elves.}{\fs24\cgrid0  The AD&D Original Edition }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 Unearthed Arcana}{\fs24\cgrid0  reference book allowed elves to become druids. Only sylvan elve
s may achieve druidhood, perhaps in remote areas such as lost islands or other worlds. Sylvan elf druids can reach 12th level (like regular clerics) and can take the Herbalist kit from }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 The Complete Book of Elves}{\fs24\cgrid0 
 (pgs. 83-84). They always fall under the for
est druid branch. Interested players might develop a druidlike priest kit for an elf, such as the halfling's Leaftender. Though drow cannot become druids, half-drow (like all half-elves) can; these almost always become gray druids.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Giant-kin}{\fs24\cgrid0 . Firbolgs and voadkyn, described in }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 The Complete Book of Humanoids}{\fs24\cgrid0 
, might become forest druids in certain remote regions of a campaign. They could reach the 7th level of ability. Again, players could develop a druidlike priest kit for this race.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Halflings.}{\fs24\cgrid0  The AD&D Original Edition game allowed halflings to reach the 6th level of ability as NPCs; }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 Unearthed Arcana}{\fs24\cgrid0 
 allowed halfling druid PCs to reach higher levels. In the AD&D 2nd Edition }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 Complete Book of Gnomes and Halflings}{\fs24\cgrid0  (pgs. 119-120), halfling priests 
gained the Leaftender kit, which strongly resembles the druid class. Leaftender priests normally may achieve 8th level. If halflings become true druids, they can reach 8th level, too, usually in the forest or plains branches.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Lizard Men.}{\fs24\cgrid0  A civilized group of lizard men on a world in the Spelljammer setting might have druids among them. Though some lizard men aboard the ship Spelljammer (detailed in }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 The Legend of Spelljammer
}{\fs24\cgrid0  boxed set) achieved high levels of clerical ability, most lizard man druids would not advance beyond 7th level. These beings become jungle or swamp druids.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Satyrs.}{\fs24\cgrid0  As a rule, satyrs concern themselves too much with having fun to bother with the serious side of a druid's life. Satyr druid PCs should not gain levels above 4th. An article 
in DRAGON Magazine issue #109, "Hooves and Green Hair," allowed half-satyrs (born of human women and satyrs) to reach 6th level or higher. Satyrs and half-satyrs always belong to the forest druid branch.
\par 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Armor and Weapons Permitted}{\fs24\cgrid0 . Most druids wear natural armor (leather) and use wooden shields. Other armors, especially metallic kinds, are forbidden to all druids.
\par \tab Most of the weapons permitted to druids of a particular branch resemble tools used in herding, hunting, and farming, or hold symbolic meaning
 to the druid. For instance, the curved scimitar and khopesh represent both the sickle used in the harvest and the crescent moon, which stands for birth, death, and rebirth in the cycle of Nature.
\par \tab The standard druid can use the following weapons: club, sickle, dart, spear, dagger, scimitar, sling, and staff (}{\i\fs24\cgrid0 optional:}{\fs24\cgrid0  scythe).
\par \tab Use of metallic weapons and tools usually remains unrestricted, but local availability can prove a problem, especially in areas like the arctic tundra. Nonmetallic materials can mak
e effective weapons, with the following modifiers (compared to similar metallic items):
\par \tab }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 Bone:}{\fs24\cgrid0  30% cost; 50% weight; -1 damage; -1 to attack roll.
\par \tab }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 Stone: }{\fs24\cgrid0 50% cost; 75% weight; -1 damage; -2 to attack roll.
\par \tab }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 Wood:}{\fs24\cgrid0  10% cost; 50% weight; -2 damage; -3 to attack roll.
\par \tab The damage modifier reduces the damage normally done by the weapon, with a minimum of 1 point of damage. The attack roll modifier does not apply to missile weapons, as the attack roll reflects the character's aim and is not a function of the mat
erial used to make the weapon. Damage modifiers do apply to missile weapons, however.
\par \tab Enchanted nonmetallic weapons must overcome the negative modifiers, too; thus a }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 bone dagger +1}{\fs24\cgrid0  works just as well as a normal steel dagger.
\par \tab Whenever a nonmetallic weapon inflicts maximum damage in combat, it has a 1 in 20 chance of breaking and becoming useless. (The DM rolls a d20.)
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Nonweapon and Weapon Proficiencies.}{\fs24\cgrid0   A druid of a particular branch must have certain proficiencies }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 required}{\fs24\cgrid0  by the branch. }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 Recommended}{\fs24\cgrid0  pr
oficiencies are only strong suggestions. If the DM permits the optional druid kits from the next chapter, select the druid's proficiencies only after you, the player, have chosen a kit, since kits have their own proficiency requirements.
\par \tab If the DM prefers to use secondary skills rather than nonweapon proficiencies, choose appropriate druidic skills from Table 36 in the}{\i\fs24\cgrid0  PH}{\fs24\cgrid0 , p. 53.
\par 
\par \tab }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 The }{\fs24\cgrid0 scythe }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 
is a weapon available to many druidic branches. Its large curved blade, sharp only on its inner edge, attaches to a handle 5 to 6 feet long. A harvesting tool used to reap grain, the scythe costs 5 gp and weighs 8 lbs. This medium-sized (M) weapon must be

they normally remain on good terms with desert nomads. Although desert druids revere all the flora and fauna of a desert, from cacti and scorpions to vultures and camels, they most fiercely protect the few fertile oases, which house their sacred groves.

\par \tab D
esert druids also may reside in semidesert areas, hot scrub lands, and chaparral. Unless a DM sets a campaign in actual desert land, this branch best suits an NPC the party may encounter traveling through the wastes. Many desert druids live as hermits, no

 fond of disturbances, and can be short tempered or downright eccentric. However, no one can top their knowledge of their own desert area. If a party seeks something in the trackless wastes or finds itself lost, facing a sandstorm, or running out of food

th the earth than with other elements of Nature. While many of them live in underground caves or ruins (especially in the Underdark), they are found any place fungal life grows abundantly, either above or below ground.
\par \tab Gray druids tend to oppose dungeon d

likelihood of involving themselves directly in the affairs of humans than other druids might. In fact, a jungle druid like Sima (pictured on p. 15) usually holds a position of power and respect, wielding great political authority.

 not associate themselves with a particular tribe or people, as do most tribal priests or witch doctors. Instead, they adopt a neutral position, mediating intertribal feuds and handling relations between human tribes and jungle-dwelling humanoids, demihum
ans, or intelligent monsters. In some cases, a great druid becomes a virtual "king of the jungle," wielding power over a coalition of several tribes, nonhumans, and animals.

, p. 79, gives guidelines for playing such characters: A Nature deity of good alignment must exist whose specialty priests are all druids. This priesthood must ally with a g
roup of rangers. Any half-elf druid/ranger must obey the level limits for demihumans (}{\i\fs24\cgrid0 DMG}{\fs24\cgrid0 
, p. 15), making it unlikely for the character to compete for high levels of druidic power. The druid/ranger's multiple interests antagonize conservative druids, and t
he character usually suffers from divided loyalties. (Create a similar character with fewer problems by giving a druid/fighter the Avenger or Beastfriend kit, described in the next chapter.)
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Druid/Mage and Druid/Fighter/Mage.}{\fs24\cgrid0  The core AD&D rules permit th

\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Dual-Class Druids}{\fs24\cgrid0 
\par \tab 
\par \tab All normal rules 
for dual-class characters apply to druids. The druid's restriction to neutral alignment limits the options to bard/druid, fighter/druid, wizard/druid, and thief/druid. Some druids prefer to see the upper ranks of the Order filled by "pure" druids those wh
o have devoted their lives solely to the Order. Dual-class characters sometimes face prejudice from other druids.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Fighter/druids.}{\fs24\cgrid0  Often acting as wandering guardians of Nature and country folk (much like neutral rangers), fighter/druids also can become her
mit-knights, living away from society and defending a particular grove with their lives. Fighters who become druids often do so because they seek spiritual growth, because they have grown disgusted with the world of man, or occasionally as penance for a p
articular misdeed. 
\par \tab Druids who become fighters, on the other hand, want to take a more direct approach to defending the wilderness; others seek to attune themselves to Nature by mastering their own bodies using eastern-style fighting arts, often becoming r
ather enigmatic Zenlike warrior-mystics.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Wizard/druids.}{\fs24\cgrid0  Looked upon with deep suspicion by most other druids, wizard/druids generally find themselves stereotyped as untrustworthy or scheming. Conservative elements within the druidic order often attempt to
 block wizard/druids from reaching 12th level. If they fail, they deliberately encourage rising druids to challenge the dual-class character to a duel in preference to other targets.
\par \tab 
Wizards usually become druids for philosophical reasons: either a fear that unrestrained use of magical or divine forces threatens the cosmic balance, or a desire to learn the druidic arts to better understand the workings of Nature. Druids who study wiza
rdry most often see this magic as another part of Nature to study and master.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Thief/druids.}{\fs24\cgrid0  Such combinations appear rarely, since the city serves as the optimum home base for the thief. As with wizard/druids, people tend to distrust thief/druids. A druid 
who becomes a thief usually does so after becoming disillusioned with the druidic order. A thief becomes a druid usually as the result of highly unusual circumstances an outlaw flees to the wilderness to escape pursuit only to befriend a local druid, come
 to love Nature, and decide to adopt a new way of life.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 High-level Dual-Class Druids.}{\fs24\cgrid0  A dual-class character who achieved a high level as a fighter or wizard before becoming a druid has an edge in the challenge a druid faces to advance beyond 11th level. F
or fairness, the Order generally bans such player characters from initiating challenges; they can gain experience levels above 11th only to fill a vacancy.
\par \tab DMs with a taste for political intrigue may permit an exception if the character receives special d
ispensation from the druidic order. This means a dual-class druid must have a sponsor: in theory, a higher-level druid who attests to the character's fairness and commitment to the Order. In practice, the sponsor is often a druid who wants a dangerous riv
al removed and believes the dual-class character has a good chance of doing so! In the case of wizard/druids, however, the Order often (but not always) forbids wizard spells during the challenge.
\par \tab A peculiar situation can occur if a character has achieved 1
2th to 15th level as a druid, then adopts another class. In effect, such characters have "dropped out" of the Order. Although inactive as druids, they retain their former Hit Dice and hit points. When they wish to use their druidic powers again (after ach
ieving one level more in the new class than their druid level), they must challenge an incumbent for the high-level druidic position they once held.
\par \tab  A dual-class character who loses the challenge must drop a level, as usual but then may face another chall
enge and another, until the player character eventually wins a position or falls to 11th level. As a result of this danger, dual-class player characters usually prefer to switch classes before reaching 12th level or after exceeding 15th level.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf13\cgrid0 Agriculture: Expanded Rules
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 
\par \tab The DM may use this expansion of the agriculture proficiency when druid characters assist a small village facing tough times or if a PC takes up farming. These rules can figure the prosperity of an entire village if the DM groups area fa
rms together and uses the proficiency rating of the village leader or druid with Tables 1 and 2. Before applying the following rules, the DM must decide how many people the farm in question is designed to support.
\par \tab A medieval farm needs a manager with the 
agriculture proficiency. At optimum level, a farm has one worker per every two people it supports. A farm with more workers may produce a slight surplus; if it has fewer workers, it will yield less, since the crew would have more chores than hands. Childr
en between ages 7 and 11 count as half a worker each, and those 12 and older each count as another full worker.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 How Did the Farm Perform?
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab To quickly determine the success of a farm (or garden or village) for the year, the DM looks at the number of peopl
e it can support. For instance, a family farm might produce enough to support six people. If the family has five members, the farm shows a profit. With six, the farm merely scrapes by. A family of seven is starting to get hungry.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Figuring Farm Profitability
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab DMs wanting more precise details about a farm's performance can follow these steps:
\par \tab 1. Determine Proficiency Base. Every year the DM rolls 1d6 and adds the result to the farmer's Intelligence score. Then, the DM locates the farmer's adjusted agriculture proficiency rating (base score) on Table 1.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Table 1: Farm Rating

\par 11-16\tab \tab Average harvest
\par 17 and up\tab Bumper crop
\par 
\par \tab 
2. Apply the Worker Modifier. The number of farm workers modifies the base proficiency score. For each 10% by which the farm crew falls below its optimum number of workers, the DM applies a -1 penalty to the base score in Table 1. If the farm has 20% more
 workers than optimum, the DM adds a +1 bonus to the base score in Table 1. (Having more workers gives no extra bonus.)
\par \tab 3. Figure the Random Events Modifier. As any farmer would tell you, what makes the farming life interesting is Nature's eternal cussedne
ss: random events. The DM should roll on Table 2 to see what's in store for the farm, then apply the random events modifier to the adjusted base score.

Ruinous weather may include flooding or a long drought. A successful weather sense proficiency check by the farmer halves the penalty. (The farmer had advance warning and prepared for the weather.) If the farmer knows a druid to use the }{\i\fs24\cgrid0

\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 4. Find the Farm's Profitability.}{\fs24\cgrid0 
 After applying the worker and random events modifiers to the base proficiency score, the DM determines profitability using Table 1. A disastrous year means the farm produces 50% less than it should. A poor harvest yields 20% less than normal. An average 
year means the farm produces at capacity. Finally, a bumper crop comes to 20% above normal yield. (Normal yield is the amount required to feed those the farm supports.)
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 The Harvest's Cash Value
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab DMs also can measure farm productivity in cash terms. The value of the harvest equals the number of people the farm can support times 36 gp (the minimum annual cost of living for a person in squalid conditions--}{\i\fs24\cgrid0 DMG}{\fs24\cgrid0 
, p. 34). The DM subtracts the yearly cost of living of the farmer and workers from the harvest value, leaving the farm's profit. With this information, the DM can see if any families are starving and how much aid would get them back on their feet.
\par \tab Determining a farm's profitability can provide role-playing opportunities for druids in a party. The guidel
ines of many branches and kits require druids to offer aid to farms and villages in need. In the course of helping, the druid can stumble on a number of adventure hooks. DMs can even design whole campaigns around a party's effort to get a farming village 
back on its feet.

\par Chapter 2: Druid Kits
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab A }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 kit}{\fs24\cgrid0  is a collection of proficiencies, restrictions, hindrances, and benefits intended to make a druid more colorful. A kit helps you, the player, create a detailed personality and background for your PC, which m
akes the character fit easily into the DM's campaign.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf13\cgrid0 Using Kits
\par 
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab A druid kit works with the basic }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 PH}{\fs24\cgrid0  druid or with any of the branches described in the previous chapter. Thus, a desert druid could be a Savage (coming from a primitive desert tribe), a Wa
nderer (traveling the desert wastes), a Guardian (protecting a certain oasis), or some other kit.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Branch and Kit 
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab When building your druid character, choose the branch first, as it has specific ability score requirements. After that, pick from any of t
he applicable kits. However, make sure you have enough proficiency slots to take the weapon and nonweapon proficiencies required by both the branch and the kit--although in many cases branch/kit proficiency requirements overlap.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 DM Restrictions
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab Prior to letting players select kits, the DM should examine each kit and decide whether it fits the overall campaign. The DM might want to restrict some kits to NPCs or prohibit others altogether.
\par \tab The DM also may wish to make changes or add material to some kits
, to better match the conditions of a particular campaign. Take the Savage druid, for instance. If the campaign already features a primitive tribe of, say, pearl divers, the DM might adjust the Savage kit to fit established details of that tribe's cultura
l background for instance, the DM might make swimming a required or bonus proficiency.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Reaction Bonuses and Penalties
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab Druid kits occasionally receive reaction bonuses or penalties as part of their special benefits and hindrances. A reaction adjustment due to either the druid kit's requirements or an extreme Charisma score (}{\i\fs24\cgrid0 PH}{\fs24\cgrid0 
, p. 18) is expressed as a bonus (+1, +2, etc.) or a penalty (-1, -2, etc.).
\par \tab When rolling 2d10 for encounter reactions (Table 59, }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 DMG}{\fs24\cgrid0 , p. 103), the DM must subtract the bonus or }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 add }{\fs24\cgrid0 
the penalty--not the other way around. For instance, the druid Snapdragon has a combined +7 reaction adjustment bonus for her high Charisma and her druid kit. The DM then subtracts 7 from the 2d10 encounter reaction roll to reflect the bonus, due to the w
ay Table 59 in the }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 DMG}{\fs24\cgrid0  is designed.

\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Kit Structure
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab Each kit entry begins with a description discussing the nature of the kit and listing any special requirements a character needs to take it. (For instance, to live as a Savage druid, 
the character must have been born into--or adopted by--a primitive tribe.) This description introduces an archetype character designed to demonstrate general attributes of the kit, }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 not }{\fs24\cgrid0 
to serve as a character you, the player, have to role-play in a campaign. A  character of either gender can take any kit.
\par \tab The kit entries also include the following sections:
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Role.}{\fs24\cgrid0  Role-playing suggestions are offered, as druids of varying kits can play widely different roles in a campaign.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Branch Restrictions.}{\fs24\cgrid0  If a member of a specific druidic branch cannot take this kit, that restriction is noted.

\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Secondary Skills.}{\fs24\cgrid0  If your DM uses the rules for secondary skills, you may choose from Table 36 (}{\i\fs24\cgrid0 PH}{\fs24\cgrid0 
, p. 53) or select one of the choices listed here, in addition to those skills appropriate to the character's druidic branch.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Nonweapon Proficiencies.}{\fs24\cgrid0  A given druid kit usually requires the character to choose certain nonweapon proficiencies. Sometimes a proficiency merely is }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 recommended}{\fs24\cgrid0 
--the character doesn't have to take it. Often kits offer a bonus proficiency, which does not use up a proficiency slot. Druids can take both priest and warrior proficiencies at normal cost (}{\i\fs24\cgrid0 PH}{\fs24\cgrid0 , pgs. 54-55).
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Equipment.}{\fs24\cgrid0  A few druid kits limit the type and amount of equipment the character can start with, acquire, or use.

\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Adviser
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab As a druid, your character can act as (or work to become) counselor to a ruler-- perhaps a local knight or a high king. Think of Merlin, whom older tales cast as a druid.
\par \tab An Adviser like the druid Elam (pictured above) tries to make himself indispensable 
to his lord. The class's well-known neutrality makes a ruler perceive his advice as nonpartisan, while the druid's high Charisma almost guarantees that the lord listens to his counsel. Elam can use his "eyes in the wilderness" (described in Chapter 4: Rol
e-playing Druids) to provide his master with timely and vital information.
\par \tab At the same time, the druid subtly manipulates his master to serve his own ends. For example, Elam might encourage his lord to hunt in a beautiful forest the druid wishes to protect
. Why? Because Elam knows the lord is a jealous man. Once he sees the beautiful forest and its fine animals, the lord will pass a law making the forest a royal game preserve. As a result, the lord's foresters will keep poachers away and prevent peasants f
rom cutting the trees down. The ruler and his courtiers will hunt there only once or twice a year'not enough to threaten the animals seriously.
\par \tab For similar reasons, a druidic Adviser like Elam might take over part of the education of the lord's children, o
stensibly to teach them herb lore, history, survival, and similar skills. Actually, he uses the opportunity to instill in them a respect for Nature and the neutral world view--and perhaps encourage them to become druids when they grow up.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Role:}{\fs24\cgrid0  As an Advi
ser, Elam is a man of subtlety and mystery. He rarely speaks unless he has something important to say, and he always thinks carefully before he says it. While not a fixture at his lord's court, he keeps an eye on things from a distance, often using animal
s to observe the ruler. He tends to pop up when most needed or least expected, stay a day or a month, then vanish into the wilds.
\par \tab Always hungry for information, Elam often roams the land disguised as a common traveler (or, at high level, in animal form), l
istening to the gossip of peasants, traders, and innkeepers to better serve his own interests and those of his lord. As a PC, he carefully considers the purpose and long-term ramifications of each adventure and insists on careful preparation and informati
on gathering before taking action.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Branch Restrictions:}{\fs24\cgrid0  None.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Weapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24\cgrid0  }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 Recommended}{\fs24\cgrid0 --staff.

 spellcraft; (rogue, double slot) reading lips; (rogue, one slot, per "Special Benefits") disguise.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Equipment:}{\fs24\cgrid0  The Adviser need not spend all starting money on equipment, but can retain any leftover coinage.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Special Benefits:}{\fs24\cgrid0  As an Adviser, Elam can purchase the rogue's disguise proficiency at normal rather than double cost. He stays free at the ruler's stronghold (no cost of living), and has the ear of the ruler.
\par \tab The DM should establish an NPC ruler for the druid to advise. Help the DM develop a reason 
why the ruler trusts the PC, beyond his druidic background. Perhaps Elam is a relative (a cousin and younger son who failed to inherit and so joined the druidic order), or the apprentice of a (recently deceased) older druid who used to tutor the lord. For
 
play balance, the DM should place a 1st-level player character as only one of several counselors to a lord of a small domain--perhaps a knightly manor or a barony. (If you, the player, really want to role-play an Adviser to a king, make it an exiled king 
trying to regain his crown.) It's up to the PC to increase the lord's influence.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Special Hindrances:}{\fs24\cgrid0  People of the lord's domain (and immediate neighbors) easily recognize Elam as the court druid. If the lord favors him or if the populace knows him to give
 good advice, many will ask him to intercede for them with the lord. In addition, he may become a target for his lord's enemies or jealous rival courtiers.
\par \tab On the other hand, if Elam fails to please his master, he will find himself in disfavor at court: H
e suffers a minimum -2 reaction penalty from the lord and court--possibly from all in the region (if his bad advice led to a spectacular failure, like defeat on the battlefield). Depending on the lord's temper, an Adviser who has fallen into disfavor may 
face exile or worse until he makes amends.

\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Avenger
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab The Avenger druid has seen Nature suffer great wrongs. Take the case of the druid Torrens. (See illustration.) He had hoped to live as a Guardian or Village Druid (listed lat
er in this chapter). However, during his training, forces defiled the area under his protection and slew his mentor. Maybe he feels he was too gentle, too weak. It doesn't matter. He won't let it happen again.
\par \tab Torrens the Avenger no longer holds the defen
sive. Instead, he roams the world seeking wrongs to right and foes to fight. And whether his opponent is a brutal king cutting down an ancient forest to build a fleet of war galleys, or an evil vampire menacing a peaceful halfling village, the Avenger act

\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab A deep--perhaps instinctive--knowledge of the ha
bits, actions, and behavior of animals comes naturally to a Beastfriend. Lasell, a typical Beastfriend character (pictured on the next page) feels quite protective of animals and fiercely punishes those who inflict unnecessary harm upon them. She has noth
ing against people hunting for food (which, after all, animals also do) but considers hunting for sport repugnant and the use of animals in gladiatorial games a horrible crime.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Role: }{\fs24\cgrid0 A Beastfriend like Lasell spends most of her time in the company of anima
ls. In fact, she lives so much of her life around animals that sometimes she lacks social graces among humans. Many Beastfriends are gruff and hostile, preferring the company of honest natural creatures to deceitful humans, demihumans, and humanoids; othe
rs like people, but feel shy or tongue-tied around them and sometimes behave with poor manners. Lasell, like most with her kit, usually travels with one or more animal companions to whom she feels especially devoted.

\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Special Benefits:}{\fs24\cgrid0  If Lasell, as a Beastfriend, carefully but fearlessly approaches a tamed or untamed animal, sh
e can try to modify the beast's reaction. The druid can affect only natural animals--that is, those found in the real world (bears, wolves, snakes, etc.), as well as giant or magically enlarged versions of normal animals. When dealing with a nonhostile or
 
domestic animal, the druid can approach and befriend it automatically. Wild beasts or animals trained to fight (like attack dogs or war horses) get a saving throw vs. rods to resist the druid at a minimum penalty of -1. An additional -1 penalty applies fo
r every four full levels the druid has achieved: -2 at 4th level, -3 at 8th, etc. (The druid's power is not magical, though.) If the animal fails to save, the druid may choose to shift its reaction one category either direction on Table 56 (}{
\i\fs24\cgrid0 DMG}{\fs24\cgrid0 , p. 103).
\par \tab The Beastfriend receives a +4 bonus on animal lore, animal training, and animal handling proficiency checks. If she does not have the actual proficiency, she can function as if she did, without the +4 bonus.
\par \tab If Lasell, as a Beastfriend, casts an Animal sphere spell on an animal, the subject saves against it at a -2 penalty.
\par \tab Thanks to her knowledge of animals, a Beastfriend can recognize a lycanthrope (whether in human or animal form) on a successful animal lore check. The Beastfriend notes subtle differenc
es in the behavior of a lycanthrope in animal form compared to a normal animal; she also notices subliminal clues in the movement and behavior of a lycanthrope in human form that point to its animal nature. The Beastfriend may make her one check only afte
r she has been in the lycanthrope's presence for a round.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Special Hindrances: }{\fs24\cgrid0 A Beastfriend does everything she can to help and treat a hurt animal or free an abused one and will kill an animal only to put a dying beast out of its misery. A Beastfriend who
 has come to know an animal may not harm it, allow others to hurt it, or send it suicidally into harm's way. In general, the Beastfriend does not recruit animals specifically as bodyguards; rather, she accumulates friends and pets, who may choose to do fa
vors for her, such as scouting or defending her. In return, the druid feeds and shelters them, heals their injuries, and rescues them from captivity.
\par \tab As with all Beastfriends, Lasell's lack of social grace prevents her from learning the etiquette proficiency and gives her a -1 penalty to encounter reactions with those of her own race (except another with her kit).

\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Guardian
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab Some
 druids establish themselves as the guardians of a particular place--the habitat of an endangered species, a stand of ancient trees, the lair of a dryad, or a sacred grove. Often the druid watches over a sacred grove with magical powers that others try to
 exploit for selfish or evil purposes.
\par \tab The DM should decide the extent of the Guardian's responsibility--usually one druid protects no more than a few acres of wilderness--and establish why the area needs special druidic attention. For instance, a mountain
top might serve as the nesting place of a rare breed of hawks prized by nobles as hunting falcons, forcing the druid to continually guard against those who want to steal the chicks or eggs.
\par \tab A druid with the Guardian kit may act as the protector of several
 places in a lifetime. Say the druidic order places Wazir, a low-level Guardian druid, in charge of a nonmagical grove. If he fulfills his charge (and rises to at least 3rd level), the Order may grant him the responsibility of a magical grove, while a low
er-level druid takes over his old position.
\par \tab In order to abandon this kit, a Guardian like Wazir has to find someone else (usually a druid of similar level) to take over his guardianship. He must a
bandon the kit involuntarily if someone destroys or irreparably desecrates his grove. In this case, the Guardian might become a Lost Druid or devote his life to revenge as an Avenger.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Role:}{\fs24\cgrid0  A Guardian lives deep in the wilderness, away from humanity. Like most Guardians, Wazir normally feels wary of strangers, suspecting that they come to exploit or threaten the site he defends.
\par \tab Some Guardians can become fiercely protective: If Wazir were to witness the near-extinction of a particular species of plant or 
animal, the last few examples of which now live only in his grove, he could grow into an angry and ruthless protector. Such druids may strike out without warning to frighten off or kill intruders or even may make pacts with local monsters to protect the g
rove.
\par \tab Other Guardians are simply shy hermits who welcome good-intentioned visitors. Perhaps Wazir lives as a lonely, dedicated sentinel; he misses human contact, but his strong sense of duty prevents him from leaving his post undefended.
\par \tab Frequently, a Guardian goes years without seeing another human; Wazir may have as his only friends just the animal or nonhuman residents of his protectorate. As a result, he may seem eccentric or awkward relating to humans--even other druids.

\par \tab As a Guardian, Wazir receives the respect of other druids (+1 reaction adjustment) in his circle. (See Chapter 3: The Druidic Order for more on circles.)
\par \tab Although not 
all Guardians serve as warders of sacred or magical groves, some receive this responsibility. (For details on these special sites, see Chapter 6: Sacred Groves.) A low-level druid character should watch over a grove with no more than one lesser power. In 
addition, the DM must come up with a good reason why a magical grove falls into the hands of a low-level druid; perhaps the original Guardian, the PC's mentor, met with an unexpected fate while still grooming the character to take over.
\par \tab Whenever a grove has any special abilities, the DM always should take care to limit the power they give the druid. For instance, a grove containing a magical pear tree with unique golden-hued fruit that gives the eater the effect of a }{
\i\fs24\cgrid0 treasure finding}{\fs24\cgrid0  potion could unbalance 
a campaign. Perhaps the tree produces only one such magical pear a year--the remaining fruit is normal, although exceptionally succulent. When the special fruit ripens, the druid must turn it over to a messenger from the great druid.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Special Hindrances:}{\fs24\cgrid0  T
he druid needs to guard a site containing something others eventually will want. The DM should encourage the player to have the character devote some time to defending the place, setting up magical or normal traps, checking with animal spies, and so on.

\par \tab I
f the druid, such as Wazir, fails in his guardianship, he becomes seriously depressed. He suffers a -1 penalty on all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability and proficiency checks until he recovers from his loss. He also loses standing in the Order (-2 
reaction penalty from other druids in the region, instead of the previous +1 bonus). Wazir cannot recover from this depression until 1d4+1 years pass }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 and }{\fs24\cgrid0 he performs some action to atone for his failure.

or spiders, ruthlessly hunting down (or lying in wait to trap) the enemies of the druidic order. A Hivemaster--s grove usually centers around the dwelling place of the creature for which the druid has the greatest affinity--a forest covered with spider we

nt ant, giant centipede, giant spider, or giant wasp. The Hivemaster may assume this insectoid form instead of one of her other shapechanging choices (bird, mammal, or reptile). For example, Cagua may choose to avoid the bird form today in favor of the in

ectoid form, but tomorrow she may decide not to shapechange into reptile form. The druid still can assume only three forms per day, just like the normal druidic shapechanging ability. Note: Gray druids with the Hivemaster kit may assume the insectoid form

 to rebuild or move on, a Lost Druid such as Struma (pictured next page) allows his heart to darken from brooding on the devastation and embraces strange magic to seek revenge.
\par \tab Under extreme stress (and the DM's discretion), a druid may renounce a particul
ar kit forever and become a Lost Druid. Druids of 2nd or higher level lose one level as a result of the change but suffer no other penalties. Note that this is an exception to the rule on abandoning kits (p. 42), so the DM may wish to restrict it to NPCs.

stroyed by orcs. He may attempt to plot the downfall of the entire orcish race and the death of every last orc. Most Lost Druids live solitary existences, but sometimes they group together, often within the sinister Shadow Circle. (See Chapter 3: The Drui

 required force during encounters: to ask foes to surrender before attacking them, let retreating enemies flee if she thinks they won't be a menace again, and so on.
\par \tab Use of herbal brews or magic that does not permanently harm enemies is perfectly appropriate. For instance, Lark can }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 entangle}{\fs24\cgrid0

savage priest, shaman, or witch doctor in that he belongs to the worldwide druidic order and, of course, to a druidic branch. Some Savage druids work and live among primitive tribes as missionaries from more civilized cultures.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Role:}{\fs24\cgrid0  Rather than associate
 with a particular tribe--as do most shamans or witch doctors--the Savage druid adopts a neutral position, mediating intertribal feuds and handling relations between human tribes and neighboring humanoids, demihumans, or intelligent monsters. Most Savages
 live as hermits in the wild, although if Haro gains high rank, he could control a coalition of tribespeople, nonhumans, and animals.
\par \tab If Haro joins a party in more civilized lands, he occupies the role of outsider and observer. The Savage character should

\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Role:}{\fs24\cgrid0  Shapeshifters have mercurial personalities. Although by no means chaotic, they are quick to anger, and easily moved to joy or tears. Rimi, like many Shapeshifter druids, makes an excelle

\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Special Benefits:}{\fs24\cgrid0  As a Shapeshifter, Rimi gains her branch's shapechanging power at 1st level rather than at 7th level. However, un
til she reaches 7th level, the druid can assume only the form of natural creatures whose Hit Dice total no greater than half her level. (A 1st-level Shapeshifter only assumes the form of a creature with 1/2 HD or less.) Rimi can shapechange}{
\i\fs24\cgrid0  twice as often}{\fs24\cgrid0  
as her branch normally allows, which doubles the number of changes she can make daily. (Forest Shapeshifters, then, can change to animal, reptile, and bird form, each twice per day.) However, using this power more than the normal three times per day may h
ave dangerous consequences. (See "Special Hindrances.")
\par \tab At 7th level, Rimi the Shapeshifter can transform a portion of her body. Instead of turning into a reptile, she can give herself a snake's fangs, which she can use in an attack to cause 1d2 bite damag
e plus poison. Rather than turning into a bird, she can transform her arms into a bird's wings and fly at a movement rate of 21. Short of transforming into a bear (or other mammal), she can sprout a bear's claws from her fingers and make two attacks causi
ng 1d3 points of damage each, plus Strength bonus. Each of these actions counts as one change for the day.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Special Hindrances:}{\fs24\cgrid0  A Shapeshifter regains hit points only when resuming her human form, and then recovers only 1d4 hp. If the druid has 0 hp or fewer, she regains none with her human shape.
\par \tab If Rimi uses her Shapeshifter power more than three times per day, she must make a saving throw vs. spell after each extra use. A failure locks her into her current form until the next day, when she can attempt a 
new saving throw. However, for each failed save, the druid's next one bears a -1 penalty. If Rimi fails three saving throws in succession, she keeps her current animal form permanently, as if she had been reincarnated as that creature. Only a }{
\i\fs24\cgrid0 polymorph any object, limited wish}{\fs24\cgrid0 , or }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 wish}{\fs24\cgrid0  can turn her back to human or another form.

\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Totemic Druid
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab The Totemic Druid closely identifies with a particula
r species of mammal, reptile, or bird. While Vanier, a typical Totemic Druid, stops short of worshiping his totem animal, he believes that particular animal represents his spirit. The Totemic Druid picks a normal (real-world) wild mammal, reptile, or bird
 
as his totem. This creature cannot be larger than a bear or smaller than a mouse. Some common choices include the black bear, bobcat, eagle, owl, wolf, rattlesnake, and beaver. In addition, Vanier's totem animal must correspond to his branch; if Vanier be
longs to the desert druid branch, he can select as his totem only an animal that normally lives in the desert.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Role:}{\fs24\cgrid0  Totemic Druids tend to adopt characteristics associated with their totem animal. They feel especially protective of their totem animal in t
he wild and want to befriend the creatures. As a Totemic Druid, Vanier acts to promote the interests of the totem species and its individual members.
\par \tab Even if his totem is traditional prey (a deer, for example), Vanier never hunts the animal himself, nor d
oes he eat its meat. While he usually does not try to ban hunting of his totem (except in the case of endangered species), he opposes cruel or wasteful hunting practices.

A Totemic Druid like Vanier can shapechange into the form of his totem animal a number of times per day equal to his experience level divided by three (rounded down), plus one. So, a 3rd- to 5th-level Totemic Druid can change twice per day, a 
6th- to 8th-level druid can change three times per day, and so on. This ability functions as normal druidic shapechanging, except that the druid does not regain hit points when shapechanging into or out of the totem form; the druid's spirit remains so clo
sely bound with the totem that he fully experiences any damage the animal form took. The Totemic Druid can use this shapechanging ability }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 in addition}{\fs24\cgrid0  to his shapechanging granted powers.
\par \tab A Totemic Druid can communicate freely with normal or giant examples of the totem animal species (as with the}{\i\fs24\cgrid0  speak with animals spell}{\fs24\cgrid0 
). He receives a +4 bonus to any healing, animal training, animal lore, or animal handling proficiency checks related to the totem. A druid who doesn't have one of these proficiencies may beh
ave as though he did when dealing with his totem animal, but does not apply the +4 bonus.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Special Hindrances:}{\fs24\cgrid0  A Totemic Druid has one fewer nonweapon proficiency slot than normal, as a result of spending so much time in animal form. So, Vanier would start with three slots rather than four.

\par \tab 
\par \tab Kabil the Village Druid (next page) associates him
self closely with a single rustic village or hamlet. As he gains experience, his influence can extend to cover a shire, barony, or entire region. However, his focus remains rural. A Village Druid always hopes to see ordinary folk live in harmony with Natu
re.
\par \tab 
As a Village Druid, Kabil's aim is twofold: to keep people from exploiting Nature (by short-sighted agricultural practices, etc.) and to defend and protect villagers who follow the proper druidic path. Thus, although he will not stand idly by to see th
e wilderness threatened, his more vital interest lies with the local crops, domestic animals, and his own followers. Kabil uses his skills and magic to protect all living things within his village from foes, disease, drought, forest fires, or natural disa
sters.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Role:}{\fs24\cgrid0 
 A Village Druid normally replaces a conventional priest or cleric in villages where most inhabitants subscribe to the druidic ethos. As well as offering protection and guidance, the druid leads the citizenry in ceremonies to observe births (of
 humans and animals), deaths, marriages, harvests, the changing of the seasons, and so on. (See Chapter 4: Role-playing Druids for details.)

\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Special Benefits: }{\fs24\cgrid0 With the DM, decide which village a druid like Kabil protects; the druid lives in or near this village.
\par \tab Locals respect Kabil highly and provide him with information about happenings in the area. He receives a +2 reaction bonus from people and domestic animals in th
e village--as long as he remains diligent about his duties. In addition, the villagers support Kabil at a middle-class lifestyle (}{\i\fs24\cgrid0 DMG}{\fs24\cgrid0 
, p. 34). This hospitality, rather than tithes, represents the generosity of a grateful people willing to provide their Village Druid with the best of everything he needs to live in their midst.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Special Hindrances:}{\fs24\cgrid0  As a Village Druid, Kabil doesn't have a lot of free time. Locals ask him for help with all their problems, ranging from bandit raids to a child lost in the woods.
 In addition, the druid must spend at least one day each week attending to village matters: listening to grievances, mediating disputes, finding lost livestock, tending animals, offering advice on crops, curing diseases, delivering babies, etc. If he miss
e
s a week, his reaction bonus drops by 1 point (minimum 0) and his income declines a step (from middle class to poor to squalid) as people become less hospitable. The druid can avoid these penalties if he arranges with someone else (another druid or a rang
er) to look after the village in his absence.
\par \tab Kabil's villagers also expect him to protect them from serious harm. If he fails or if no one sees him at least making an honest effort the DM may reduce or eliminate his reaction bonus and benefits for as long
 as the villagers likely would feel resentful. Role-playing can win back a Village Druid's lost respect; Kabil can regain his lost reaction bonus and benefits quickly by doing a great deed to benefit the village, or slowly by simply completing his duties 
diligently for several months.

 of many druids 3rd level and higher to travel through overgrowth or other difficult terrain without penalty.)

\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 
\par \tab The druidic order--often simply called the Order--can be thought of as a federation of regional priesthoods that form a loosely organized worldwide faith, all of whose members worship Nature and follow a similar ethical philosophy.
\par \tab Druids divide up their world into regions, here called }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 domains}{\fs24\cgrid0 . A domain is a well-defined geographic area bounded by mountain ra
nges, rivers, seas, or deserts-- druids normally divide a good-sized continent into three or four domains. Druidic regions do not rely on national borders, or on racial or ethnic groups; a domain can encompass several countries, races, and peoples.
\par \tab For ex
ample, in a fantasy world based on our Earth, one European domain might include England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, and the Channel Islands; a second could consist of Western Europe (west of the Rhine and north of the Alps and Pyrenees, bounded by the Nort
h Sea and the English Channel to the north and the Bay of Biscay to the west); a third might contain Southern Europe (south of the Alps and bounded by the Mediterranean Sea and Danube River); another would include the Iberian peninsula.
\par \tab North America could
 be divided into an Atlantic domain (east of the Mississippi River and south of the St. Lawrence River and Great Lakes), a Pacific domain (west of the Rocky Mountains), a Central domain (between the two domains above, roughly south of the Missouri River),
 a Caribbean domain, a Southern domain (south of the Rio Grande and east of the Rockies), and a Northern domain (all of North America roughly north of the Missouri and Ohio rivers and east of the Rocky Mountains).

. Circles typically are named for the geographic area their domain occupies, but sometimes they bear other names, harking back to their founders or the gods the druids worship (if they worship deities rather
 than Nature itself). For instance, druids might have formed "The Dragon Isles Circle" or "The Circle of Danu."
\par \tab The members of a circle hold themselves responsible for the well-being of the wilderness and the continuation of the orderly cycles of Nature w
ithin their domain. This doesn't mean a circle remains unconcerned about what occurs in other domains--forming circles is just the druidic order's way of recognizing that those druids who live in a particular region can best serve to protect it, and shoul
d therefore hold formal responsibility for the domain.
\par \tab Circles operate within a very loose structure. They use no large temples or abbeys, for rarely do more than a few druids live together. When they do, their dwelling places are usually less than ostenta
tious: small cottages or huts of the style of local hunters or farmers. All druids within the circle acknowledge a single great druid as their leader and recognize this figure's moral authority. The great druid gives the circle's members great freedom com
pared to most other religious leaders. The druids adhere to a rather informal hierarchical structure and require their initiates to hold true to the basic ethos of the druidic order and respect higher-ranking druids.
\par \tab A few traditions described in this chap
ter have grown up to govern the harmonious workings of a circle: initiations, the challenge, the ban, the moot, and selection of acolytes. All druids, from the humblest initiate to the great druid, may freely follow their own interpretation of druidic bel
iefs and act however they believe best serves Nature.

\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Druidic Demographics
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab A typical domain (one that has seen no persecution of druids but includes other priestly faiths as well) contains, on average, one druid for every 10 square miles of rural farmla
nd or 400 square miles of lightly inhabited wilderness or steppe. Druids dwelling in rural areas usually are initiates (1st to 8th level, generally). Those in the wilderness usually have reached higher experience levels, frequently 7th to 11th level. A ci
rcle may include a maximum of nine 12th-level druids, three 13th-level druids, and one 14th-level druid. Often circles have no higher-level druids at all.
\par \tab Below 12th level, the number of druids of a given experience level stands at about double the populat
ion of the next level up. So, a typical circle may include 18 initiates of 11th level, 36 initiates of 10th level, etc., all the way down to some 18,000 1st-level initiates. The entire circle thus consists of more than 36,000 druids. A domain might featur
e one druid per 500 to 1,000 citizens, although this statistic gives a distorted picture, since druids are concentrated in some locales and rare in others.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Circles and Branches
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab Chapter 1: Druid Characters examined the different branches of the Order: fo
rest druids, desert druids, and so on. A given circle normally covers a domain vast enough to include members from several, but usually not all, branches. A domain with a temperate climate might contain a circle composed of forest, swamp, and mountain dru
ids. In contrast, a circle in a tropical domain with flat terrain would consist of jungle, plains, desert, and swamp druids.
\par \tab All druids should possess an equivalent number of advantages and disadvantages regardless of branch. However, equality is never gua
ranteed. In most fantasy worlds, the forest druids exercise the most influence. Due to the resources of the woodlands and humanity's desire to clear them for use as farms, forest druids often consider their problems the most pressing. The Order's prioriti
e
s frequently reflect this stance; circles dominated by forest druids try to make sure that a member of that branch ends up as Grand Druid, the leader of the druidic order. As jungle druids and swamp druids share many of the forest druids' concerns, they o
ften become allies.
\par \tab A well-balanced druid sees each branch as part of a single tree, all equally important. Unfortunately, though, not all druids have this vision. Members of the informal forest-plains-swamp-jungle coalition sometimes look down upon desert
 and arctic druids due to the relative infertility of their habitats. Sometimes druids fall too deeply in love with their own particular part of the world--forest druids who see trees as the be-all and end-all of Nature may hold arctic, desert, and gray d
r
uids to be inferior. The victims of such prejudice, in turn, can come to resent the forest branch. Great druids from the few circles dominated by arctic or desert druids often ally to try to keep a forest druid from becoming Grand Druid-- although more of
ten than not, they fail.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Initiates
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab Initiates constitute the 1st- to 11th-level druids within a circle. Their experience level determines their role in the circle.
\par \tab A typical 1st- or 2nd-level initiate (an NPC) often works part time as a Village Druid. T
his initiate keeps up a rural occupation (beekeeper, farmer, herder, etc.) while studying under a higher-level druid mentor. The exceptions to this stereotype are rare individuals (PCs). An average person finds it tough to recognize beginning druids, sinc
e most seem just like other peasants.
\par \tab Initiates b
etween 3rd and 6th level have achieved most of their granted powers, with the exception of shapechanging. The cornerstones of the druidic order, they frequently devote their full time to their faith. They normally live in stone, wood, or mud-brick cottage
s
 and act as the protectors of a small tract of wilderness--a wood or river valley--or of a village or group of hamlets. Most druids of this status have the Village Druid or Guardian kit, and those who choose to protect a village usually have become respec
ted community leaders.
\par \tab Initiates between 7th and 11th level have received all their branch's granted powers. Such druids live simply but have widened their areas of influence, perhaps becoming the guardians of entire forests or mountains, or of all the vil
lages in a barony. These druids often dwell near a sacred grove surrounded by a few acres of virgin wilderness a sanctuary for rare and magical plants, animals, and supernatural creatures. This natural setting may be magically defended as well. Temporal r
ulers of the area respect (or fear) druids of such level.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf13\cgrid0 High-level Druids
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 
\par \tab Only a limited number of druids in a given circle can reach the}{\i\fs24\cgrid0  inner circle}{\fs24\cgrid0 --nine of druid rank, three archdruids, and a single great druid. A character cannot replace one of th
ese druids without having sufficient experience. In addition, a vacancy must open up, or the rising druid must defeat one of the current higher-level characters the druidic challenge to assume a new rank.
\par \tab Some tension exists between druids of the inner ci
rcle, since they remain constantly aware that a subordinate may be preparing a challenge. Unlike clerics, who normally settle down by this point, high-level druids continue adventuring as part of their duties and to stay in shape to fend off challengers.

\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Druids
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab Upon reaching 12th level, a character receives the official title }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 druid}{\fs24\cgrid0 
, of which a circle never has more than nine. (Lower-level characters, though called "druids" by most, are technically "initiates.") A druid's role in the circle resembles that of a 7th- to 11th-level initiate, with some exceptions.
\par \tab At 12th level, a druid has gained access to the }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 commune with nature}{\fs24\cgrid0  spell and should use it along with other druidic resources to aggressively root out emergent threats to the wilderness within a d
omain. Druids attend the High Council of the Moot (described later this chapter) and always act based on the needs of the circle as a whole. The circle's great druid at times asks 12th-level druids for advice and sends them on missions for the good of the
 circle.
\par \tab But the life of a druid involves more than just adventuring--serving as a mentor takes up much of a druid's time, too. Selecting young people to train as druidic candidates constitutes a major responsibility of those who reach druid rank. Each yea
r druids (and other inner circle members) pick the single most worthy of their advanced students to initiate into the Order as 1st-level druids. (For more on initiations, see Chapter 4: Role-playing Druids.)
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Archdruids
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab A 13th-level druid is called an }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 archdruid}{\fs24\cgrid0 . Each circle can have only three archdruids and, as with the druid rank, advancement requires either filling a vacancy or winning a challenge against a seated archdruid.
\par \tab An archdruid's role resembles that of a druid, with two differences. Archdru
ids concern themselves more with maintaining the balance of Nature, making sure no one alignment or ethos comes to utterly dominate the domain. Also, archdruids spend time training to step into the role of the great druid. To accomplish both these goals, 
they devote much time to travel, ensuring their familiarity with the geography--human, natural, and magical--throughout the domain.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 The Moot.}{\fs24\cgrid0  The three archdruids share the druid's responsibility for initiating newcomers to the Order. In addition, they eac
h have the right to summon a moot: a gathering of the entire circle, traditionally held at the solstices and equinoxes. By ancient custom, moots are called four times a year at these set dates, once by each archdruid and once (usually in spring) by the gr
eat druid. A moot on a nontraditional date means the summoner sees something so deeply amiss in the domain that the entire circle must discuss it as soon as possible.
\par \tab These gatherings enable the circle to celebrate the changing of the seasons, to gossip an
d socialize, to exchange information on the state of the domain, and to fight druidic challenges before an audience. Druids at a moot perform ceremonies to celebrate Nature, honor their dead, marry a couple within the Order, and initiate new 1st-level dru
ids. Along with these ceremonial duties, small groups at moots disappear together into the wilds to talk quietly while searching for herbs or mistletoe.
\par \tab The climax of any such gathering is the High Council of the Moot; the circle's nine druids, three archd
ruids, and great druid meet in a secret location to discuss the state of the domain and make plans to rally the circle against a particular problem, if necessary. Sometimes an ambassador from a neighboring circle (usually a character of at least druid ran
k) or an emissary of the Grand Druid attends a council. These personages bring news and greetings--and sometimes requests for help. After the High Council, the great druid (or an archdruid) addresses the entire moot, answers questions, and takes advice.

\par \tab To
 call a moot, an archdruid (or the great druid) sends messengers out across the domain to spread the word to druids of all branches. All members of the circle above 7th level must attend or explain the absence. Members of 3rd to 6th level may come, but us
ually do so only if their journeys bring them to the vicinity or if they have business with others there. Those of 1st or 2nd level may attend a moot only with the permission of a member of the inner circle.
\par \tab The moot is scheduled to begin two weeks after t
he summoner dispatches the announcements, giving all druids in the circle enough time to settle their business and arrive. Such a gathering generally takes place at a sacred grove under the stewardship of the summoner. Though most moots last about four da
ys, the meeting cannot end until the summoning archdruid or the great druid dissolves it.
\par \tab Bards, elves, rangers, swanmays, and other sylvan folk often are invited to a moot, but its location remains a secret to others. In troubled times, elves, rangers, fr
iendly beasts, or forest creatures may patrol the moot and take trespassers prisoner.
\par \tab If the domain's circle is on good terms with the land's rangers, a spring or autumnal moot may take place in conjunction with a rangers' forgathering. (See Chapter 10: Forgatherings in}{\i\fs24\cgrid0  The Complete Ranger's Handbook}{\fs24\cgrid0 
.) However, like rangers, druids prefer to keep their gatherings to themselves, and such cooperation usually results from personal friendships between the great druid and notable rangers--or signals a desperate alliance against a greater foe.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Great Druids}{\fs24\cgrid0 
\par \tab 
\par \tab As stated earlier, the }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 great druid}{\fs24\cgrid0  leads a circle. Like other inner circle members, the great druid usually has won the position through the challenge and has to maintain 
the ascendancy by defeating other challengers. However, some great druids become so respected (or feared!) that subordinate archdruids forgo challenging them, instead preferring to enter the service of the Grand Druid or wait until the great druid advance
s in level.
\par \tab All druids within a circle know the name of their great druid--even if they have never met in person--because this figure wields a certain amount of power over their lives. The DM should decide how strongly the great druid influences the member
s of the circle. For instance, a great druid who is loved, respected, or feared holds more sway over NPC druids than would a weak or unpopular leader. While PCs remain free to pursue their own goals, opposing the policy of a strong great druid means a cha
racter has little chance of receiving support from superior druids. Supporting the leader's policy, on the other hand, can win lesser druids praise and aid from the top.
\par \tab Turmoil can erupt within a circle governed by a weak or unpopular great druid, as the 
ranking archdruids vie for the head post or ignore the leader's advice to follow their own paths. Player characters may get occasional assistance from inner circle druids in this scenario, but for the most part, individuals all go their own way.
\par \tab The great
 druid has the same power to initiate druidic candidates and summon a moot as archdruids. In addition, this figure has the job of maintaining harmonious relations among all the druids of the circle--preventing factional battles and infighting, other than 
what is allowed through the challenge. To do so, the great druid has one special tool: the ban.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 The Ban.}{\fs24\cgrid0  The great druid can impose a strong, nonviolent sanction upon those who have offended the circle. All must shun someone placed under the ban; no druid 
in the circle will aid, speak to, or associate with the target of the ban. When an entire town or village suffers the ban, no druid may enter that area or speak to or aid any resident. Some druidic allies volunteer to follow the custom of the ban as well.
 For instance, a clan of sprites or centaurs on good terms with a circle may receive word of a ban and choose to honor it.
\par \tab The great druid has the right to pronounce a ban on any druid in the circle. A ban also can cover nondruids, whole communities, or dr
uids visiting from other domains (except the Grand Druid and personal servants), to demonstrate the circle's displeasure.
\par \tab To pronounce the ban, the great druid stands up during a moot and announces to the group the reasons to impose the ban. Then the subj
ect of the ban--if present--answers the accusations before the assembly. Finally, the High Council of the Moot votes on the matter openly, usually at sunset. If a majority of the council votes in favor of the ban, it passes. If not, the great druid should
 start keeping an eye on the circle's archdruids--the opposition to the ban likely reflects an impending challenge.
\par \tab A ban punishes a druid for violating the tenets of the druidic order or reprimands a character whose actions, while within the bounds of the
 druidic ethos, nevertheless were contrary to the Order's interests. For instance, suppose an angry druid massacred the inhabitants of a human hamlet because they would not turn over two hunters who slew a stag in the druid's sacred grove. The druid acted
 
within the bounds of the druidic ethos, but the great druid might call the character's indiscriminate vengeance out of proportion to the crime, adding that the slaughter has threatened to make local commoners hate and fear all druids in the circle. So, th
e great druid imposes the ban, both as a punishment and as incentive for the character to change.
\par \tab Nondruid individuals are less likely to fall victim to a ban--usually the great druid finds that direct action against the offender proves more effective. How
ever, if the people of an area depend on druids rather than other priests for healing and religious ceremonies, a ban sends them a message of disapproval. And sometimes a ban can serve as a symbolic gesture against a subject too powerful or influential to
 confront directly--a baron or king, for instance.
\par \tab A ban generally lasts 10 summers. However, the inner circle can vote to lift a ban early or (once the time is up) to extend it. The shunning does not extend outside the domain, so banned druids usually cho
ose to go into exile--the result the great druid probably intended in the first place.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 The Challenge.}{\fs24\cgrid0  The traditions of the Order prohibit an inner circle from including more than nine druids, three archdruids, and one great druid. If a character gains en
ough experience to achieve official druid level but finds no vacancy in the inner circle, the only way to advance involves ceremonial combat: the druidic challenge.
\par \tab The challenge remains one of the oldest druidic traditions. It purges the weak and complac
ent, ensuring that the highest ranks of the druidic order remain filled with strong and cunning individuals. The masters of the druidic order are not politicians, but men and women of action. They believe that the challenge, by bringing ambition into the 
open, allows them to by-pass some of the worst excesses of hypocrisy and behind-the-scenes power plays found in other religions.
\par \tab A circle's great druid expects at any time to face a challenge from one of the archdruids, while the archdruids keep an eye on 
rising druids. Those of druid rank, in turn, look out for ambitious 11th-level initiates. This system puts a constant strain on the Order's upper ranks: It's hard to stay on good terms with folk who want your job and eventually will challenge you to a bat
tle to gain it. As a result, most friendships and alliances form among druids of equal level or among characters several levels apart.
\par \tab All inner circle druids do their best to appear strong, to avoid looking like easy targets. Many actively adventure to en
hance their reputations and gain power through acquiring magical items and experience. Others simply try to remain popular among the other members of the Order. If an inner circle member takes an unpopular or controversial stance, fellow druids may decide
 to encourage the ambitious to aim for that particular target; the replacement would likely prove more cordial.
\par \tab The challenge operates under prearranged rules: Characters who violate the letter of the rules will fail to advance in level, just as if they ha
d suffered defeat. Always a one-on-one battle, the challenge does not allow even servants or animal companions of the combatants to participate.
\par \tab First, the two parties must agree upon the time of the duel--if they can't agree, it will take place at the next moot. Druids consider it impolite to set a challenge outside of a moot, although it's still done.
\par \tab Second, the challenge needs a witness--a druid whose level equals or exceeds the challenger's. Hierophant druids (described later in this chapter) work we
ll as witnesses, as do druids or archdruids visiting from different circles or from the Grand Druid's entourage. This individual must witness the terms of the challenge and make sure the combatants obey the rules. The great druid of the circle always name
s the witness, even if the challenge involves that very leader.
\par \tab Third, the terms by which the battle will be fought are set out by mutual agreement. Once agreed upon and witnessed, the terms may not change. If neither side can agree on the terms, the witne
ss selects them and proclaims the duel an all-out battle until one druid surrenders or becomes incapacitated.
\par \tab Terms to discuss include:

The size of the battlefield. Until the duel ends, leaving the bounds of the area means conceding defeat. Usually the space is no more than a dozen yards across, to ensure the battle does not take too long.

 granted powers--no spells or weapons. The combatants used only the claws and fangs of their different animal forms. A few challenges have forbidden all weapons and magic--they became simple wrestling matches.

\par }\pard \nowidctlpar\tx0\tx450{\*\pn \pnlvlcont\ilvl0\ls0\pnrnot0\pndec }\adjustright {\fs24\cgrid0 \tab The challenge begins with the witness's invocation, asking Nature (
or a druidic deity) to watch over the duel. This means that challengers who defeat foes through cheating will find themselves unable to gain a level after all, and incumbents who cheat automatically lose the level. Once the witness concludes the invocatio
n, the druids enter the battlefield from opposite ends, and the contest begins.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Appointment of Acolytes.}{\fs24\cgrid0  Great druids, archdruids, and druids have the traditional right to select initiates as their servants. The number and level of these retainers depends 
on the level and position of the inner circle member. (See the }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 PH}{\fs24\cgrid0 , p. 37, for details.) The chosen initiates are called }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 acolytes}{\fs24\cgrid0 .
\par \tab Acolytes, chosen from the high-ranking druid's own circle, are restricted to serving only certain inner circle members (again, based on their experience level). The appointing druid must determine which eligible initiates will serve him.
\par \tab An inner circle druid usually approaches a favored initiate quietly and offers an acolyte position. The initiate then decides whether to accep
t the post. While serving as an acolyte holds honor, it also entails a loss of freedom. Therefore, the decision depends on factors such as the reputation of the inner circle member.
\par \tab 
An acolyte swears an oath of service: to be loyal and obedient, to listen and learn, to keep no secrets from one's master, but to guard the master's secrets. An acolyte who breaks this oath faces the wrath of the high-ranking druid. In addition, unless th
e acolyte can prove the master's commands violated the spirit of the druidic ethos, the servant usually becomes subjected to the ban.
\par \tab The advantage of serving as an acolyte is that the character wins the patronage, and perhaps the friendship, of a powerful
 druid. The position enhances the initiate's prestige in the eyes of the entire circle. Furthermore, acolytes injured or wronged by an enemy can expect assistance from their master.
\par \tab The disadvantage? The character-- always at the beck and call of a master
-- loses personal freedom. An acolyte fulfills all the normal duties of a loyal retainer but, most importantly, acts as an emissary and representative of the inner circle druid. As high-level druids cannot be everywhere at once, acolytes often go on long 
j
ourneys to do their master's bidding. Whether the mission involves finding a reclusive swamp-dwelling initiate to notify of the next moot's date and location or delivering a stinging ultimatum to a dwarven king to shut down his mines or face the circle's 
wrath, acolytes can expect to visit a lot of interesting--though sometimes unpleasant--places.
\par \tab An acolyte's term of service lasts until the master's experience level changes or until the acolyte advances a level. In the latter case, the acolyte leaves service, and the inner circle member must select a replacement.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 The Grand Druid
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab Above all others within the Order stands the figure of the }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 Grand Druid}{\fs24\cgrid0 , the highest-ranking (although not the highest-level) druid in the world. The Grand Druid, a 15th-level c
haracter, attains this position through a selection process rather than by the challenge. Since only one person can hold the title of Grand Druid, each world can have only one 15th-level druid at a time.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Duties of the Grand Druid}{\fs24\cgrid0 . First and foremost, the Grand Druid acts as a politician, responsible for keeping harmony between the great druids of each domain and between the various druidic branches.
\par \tab The Grand Druid also rallies the circles against the rare global threat to Nature or the cosmic balance. Th
is always proves a difficult task, as many circles fiercely cherish their autonomy, believing each one should remain self-sufficient and not meddle in other domains' affairs. Few circles willingly send contingents off to aid other circles unless they feel
 
absolutely certain that the threat will menace their own domain as well. To make matters worse, the inflated pride of many circles prevents them from accepting help from "foreign" druids. As a result, often only one thing can convince the Order a threat w
arrants a combined effort: the destruction of an entire circle. Fortunately, such occurrences are few and far between.
\par \tab The Grand Druid and entourage (detailed below) spend most of their time visiting different regions and speaking to the great druids, arch
druids, druids, and, rarely, lowly initiates. In particular, this leader serves as a diplomat and peacemaker, who mediates disputes between druids of neighboring circles and struggles involving members of the mysterious Shadow Circle (described later in t
his chapter).
\par \tab Normally the circles act with autonomy. However, if a circle appears in great disarray--for instance, an enemy has killed most of its members or forced them into hiding--the Grand Druid may try to rally the circle or recruit aid from other do
mains. If a circle has been effectively destroyed, the Grand Druid might decide to rebuild it from scratch. After selecting a rising archdruid from a neighboring circle to step in as the new great druid, the Grand Druid helps recruit volunteers from nearb
y domains to replenish the circle. Often this assignment proves difficult and dangerous; whatever destroyed the previous circle probably still lurks nearby, ready to pounce on the new circle that, while wary, will remain understrength for some time.

\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Servants of the Grand Druid.}{\fs24\cgrid0 
 Like other inner circle druids, the Grand Druid has personal servants: an entourage of nine druids of various levels. These druids no longer owe allegiance to their original circles but are subject only to the Grand Druid. All druids
 consider it a high honor to serve the leader of the Order, an honor that bears great responsibility but gives a druid prestige and influence far beyond others of similar level. Assuming a vacancy arises--and service involves enough danger that openings o
ccur reasonably often--a druid of any level can seek out the Grand Druid and petition to become a retainer. This relationship lasts as long as both sides wish--often many years--and can end by mutual agreement at any time.
\par \tab Three archdruids, often called th
e Emissaries, always serve the head of the Order. They act as the Grand Druid's personal agents--their leader's eyes, hands, and voice. To aid them in their duty, they receive four additional spell levels (one 4th-level spell, two 2nd-level spells, etc.),
 
usable as they see fit. To keep the Grand Druid informed on the operations of the circles in every land, they roam the world, visiting the various circles as well as other places of interest to their master. The arrival of an Emissary often coincides with
 
the ascendance of a new great druid. While conveying the respects of the head of the Order, the archdruid takes the new leader's measure and reports back to the Grand Druid. These servants also visit a circle in response to a great druid's request for aid
.
\par \tab Traveling Emissaries normally find themselves welcomed, for their visits give circles a chance to learn news from far-off lands. An Emissary also may offer counsel about a menace or carry a request for help to the Grand Druid or neighboring circles.

\par \tab But
 Emissaries also must remain on the alert for problems within a circle that the great druid has failed to adequately handle--such as widespread conflicts between druids or corruption in the ranks. In such cases, it is the Emissary's solemn duty to take ac
t
ion to remedy the problem or, lacking sufficient power, to report it the Grand Druid. For this reason, some circles-- particularly those secretly dominated by the ruthless Shadow Circle--regard the arrival of an Emissary with deep suspicion. In their role
 as agents of the Grand Druid, these archdruids sometimes resemble spies. More than one Emissary has met a mysterious end while visiting a supposedly friendly circle.
\par \tab Besides the Emissaries, a Grand Druid has six other servants. These druids, usually of 7t
h to 11th level, come from a variety of branches but have all proven their dedication to the Order. Many Grand Druids have been known to take on the occasional lower-level druid, either because they feel the need for a fresher viewpoint or because they se
nse a special worthiness in a particular individual. These six druids of mixed level act as servants, counselors, bodyguards, and useful agents.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Selection of the Grand Druid.}{\fs24\cgrid0  One of the duties each Grand Druid must perform is appointing a successor, always
 an acting great druid. After serving usually a minimum of four years, a Grand Druid steps down to allow the chosen successor to assume the mantle of leadership.
\par \tab In theory, selecting a new Grand Druid is solely up to the last Grand Druid. In practice, dru
idic order politics plays a major role. For instance, if the forest druids have held the position of Grand Druid for several generations, they may come to consider it "their right" to do so. However, in the name of fairness and harmony, druids from other 
b
ranches may lobby to convince the current Grand Druid to pick a successor from a different branch. On the other hand, choosing a Grand Druid from a minority branch could alienate large segments of the druidic order's membership, even with an extremely com
petent Grand Druid.
\par \tab As a result, when a Grand Druid begins getting on in years, the impending choice of successor becomes the subject of much gossip, speculation, lobbying, and intrigue by archdruids, great druids, and hierophant druids. For instance, a gr
eat druid afraid of being passed over for the position in favor of a rival may encourage a powerful, ambitious archdruid to challenge that rival, hoping to put the favorite out of the running before the Grand Druid can finalize the succession.

\par \tab The }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 hierophants}{\fs24\cgrid0  make up a unique part of the druidic order. Some even go so far as to say they }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 are }{\fs24\cgrid0 
the Order, and that the other ranks represent mere practice for hierophant status. Check p. 38 of the }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 PH }{\fs24\cgrid0 for details on achieving the rank of hierophant (pictured on the next page) and the powers that go with it.
\par \tab Hierophant druids live as free agents. They are encouraged to respect the Grand Druid, but need not obey the druidic leader's mandates nor operate within the borders of any circle. Although
 a few settle down in particular groves, many become famous wanderers, some even visiting other planes or (by spelljamming) distant worlds. They often travel about in disguise, using their appearance-alteration powers. Wherever they go and whatever they d
o, they always aim to promote the ethos and values of the druidic order.
\par \tab Unlike lesser druids, hierophants typically have a global perspective and agenda. They concern themselves with the rise and fall of empires, the migrations of peoples, the growth or e
xtinction of species, and the role of each race in the destiny of the world. Some devote their lives to a particular cause, such as reclaiming the forests of a continent infected by evil, or acting as the personal nemesis of a being whose actions threaten
 the world's balance.
\par \tab Hierophants are notorious behind-the-scenes manipulators. They use their long life spans to weave subtle schemes with far-reaching plots that might take decades to hatch, but which--they believe--ultimately will benefit their cause. T
he 17th-level druidic ability to hibernate enables most of them to appear effectively immortal: some hierophants will hatch the initial elements of a scheme, go into hibernation, then awaken decades later, unaged, to bring the next stage into play. Such d
ruids might become patrons of gifted families of adventurers, recruiting the latest generation when they need heroes.
\par \tab The existence of hierophant druids tends to make great druids and Grand Druids very nervous, for they represent a power beyond their control--and sometimes beyond their ken. Whether any hierophant druids belong to the Shadow Circle is not known.

\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf13\cgrid0 The Shadow Circle
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 
\par \tab The druidic order tolerates a wide range of philosophies under the umbrella of its loosely organized structure. The variety of different branches demonstrates this scope. So does the existence of the Shadow Circle.
\par \tab A secret society of druids within the la
rger druidic order, the Shadow Circle accepts members who see Nature as a hostile, cleansing force that ensures the survival of the fittest. According to their philosophy, civilization--especially the building of towns and cities--has weakened humankind a
nd many demihuman races.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Methods
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab The Shadow Circle
 sees barbarian humans and more primitive races as inherently more vital than civilized peoples. Thus, the Shadow Circle often allies itself with barbarian tribes or hostile humanoids such as orcs, giants, and goblins, especially those who choose to live 
in forests or mountains in the wilds. They deliberately encourage people to abandon civilization's "decadence" and return to the more natural existence of hunting and gathering.
\par \tab But while their intentions are neutral, the methods of Shadow Circle members t
end to promote chaos and evil. They behave as they do not due to an evil nature--their enemies include powerful evil empires as well as good kingdoms. Rather, they feel their cruel activities work toward the best interests of evolution and of Nature itsel
f. For instance, the Shadow Circle may provide magical assistance to barbarian hordes trying to sack a city or lead humanoid tribes in raids against human or dwarven towns.
\par \tab Sometimes the Shadow Circle even assists the cause of good. For instance, members w
ould consider an evil city-state based around slavery a fair target, and they would feel as eager as any lawful good paladin to support a slave revolt in the hopes of toppling the city. The difference? The Shadow Circle would encourage the slaves in revol
t to burn the city to the ground and then settle down as farmers, hunters, or outlaws in the countryside.
\par \tab Lower-ranking members of the Shadow Circle often wage campaigns of terror against small settlements, usually working behind the scenes. Their favorite puppets are intelligent monsters like evil lycanthropes.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Membership
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab The members of the Shadow Circle keep their allegiance secret from other druids while maintaining their parallel "circle" rankings. An archdruid in the Shadow Circle is also an archdr
uid in a mainstream circle, for example. Shadow Circle druids of 11th level or higher follow the normal druidic practice of advancing in level through the challenge; in fact, Shadow Circle druids encourage each other to challenge nonmembers in mainstream 
circle hierarchy, thereby increasing their number among inner circle members. These duels almost invariably turn quite bloody.
\par \tab An arc of the Shadow Circle exists in any domain where druids live, and its members may come from any druidic branch. Typically o
nly one in five initiates--but as many as one in three 12th-level or higher druids--secretly belongs to the Shadow Circle. A great druid usually is not a member, but one never can tell for sure. In some troubled domains--particularly those in which druids
 face persecution and the wilderness displays signs of wanton destruction from human cities--}{\i\fs24\cgrid0 most }{\fs24\cgrid0 of the druids may join the Shadow Circle!
\par \tab Shadow Circle druids adopt secret names to conceal their identities from each other. When they meet, they do so whil
e shapechanged or wearing masks carved to represent predators native to the domain. This secrecy is important. Although the Shadow Circle ethos corresponds to that of the Order, most druids disdain the group's methods--and therefore, its members.
\par \tab A known 
Shadow Circle initiate faces the enmity of other druids--and possibly the ban, for refusing to recant--as well as the ire of local authorities. Lower-level druids constantly challenge exposed Shadow Circle druids 12th level and higher, seeking to depose--
and possibly destroy--offenders.
\par \tab In turn, the Shadow Circle often tries to cause trouble within the druidic order. For instance, in order to recruit disaffected druids into their midst, group members covertly encourage rivalry between druidic branches (suc
h as the jealousy between the dominant forest druids and the members of less influential branches). Characters may learn of the Shadow Circle when they discover a plot to ferment such trouble between druids from rival branches.
\par \tab Note that these are the methods of a group of extremist druids, not evil ones. Their anti-civilization feelings do not alter their neutral alignment.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Shadowmaster.}{\fs24\cgrid0  The highest-level druid in the Shadow Circle--usually an archdruid or druid--takes command of the group as the Shadowm
aster. If two or more druids of equal level seek the post, they generally duel to the death, though one combatant--usually the younger--could agree to serve under the other. Unlike the semiautonomous mainstream circles, the Shadow Circle maintains strict 
discipline over its various far-flung arcs. The Shadowmaster exercises absolute authority over the membership.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Inner Circle.}{\fs24\cgrid0  Under the Shadowmaster are the members of the inner circle, which consists of all the druidic order's Shadow Circle druids (12th le
vel) and archdruids (13th level). (The Shadowmaster remains apart from the inner circle.) Together, the Shadowmaster and the inner circle make policy and direct the initiates. Only the Shadowmaster knows the real names of members of the inner circle--the 
identities of even these high-ranking members remain unknown to each other.
\par \tab The 1st- through 10th-level initiates within this secret society, unlike the more independent initiates of mainstream circles, are expected to obey all orders from inner circle members and the Shadowmaster. Failure means punishment--death.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Shadowed Ones.}{\fs24\cgrid0  Initiates who have reached 11th level have special status in the Shadow Circle. These initiates are known as "Shadowed Ones," the Shadowmaster's special tools. In particular, they 
act as enforcers and assassins for the secret group, hunting those who have disobeyed their fearsome leader or have been expelled from the mysterious society. The Shadowmaster sometimes encourages Shadowed Ones to serve as ambassadors to arcs of the Shado
w Circle operating in other domains. Shadowed Ones automatically advance to the inner circle in this secret group when they achieve 12th level in their mainstream circle.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Shadowclave
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab Members of the Shadow Circle work in secret, pretendi
ng to be mainstream druids. For example, they attend all druidic moots. But every season each arc of the Shadow Circle also holds its own secret meeting--the Shadowclave--in the dark of the moon. The meeting lasts three nights, during which the membership
 
celebrates its own version of traditional druidic ceremonies and receives new orders from the Shadowmaster and inner circle. Prisoners the Shadow Circle has taken throughout the season--along with disloyal or disobedient members--are kept alive until the 
Shadowclave. There, the inner circle tortures and publicly executes them, to remind the membership of what happens to traitors and enemies of the Shadow Circle.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Recruitment
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab The Shadow Circle does not take volunteers--it finds new members on its own. Rec
ruitment, by invitation only, is in the hands of the Shadowmaster and the inner circle, always on the lookout for druids who seem ready to embrace the ruthless Shadow Circle philosophy.
\par \tab For example, if a druid massacres a party of travelers who ventured i
nto a sacred grove, the Shadow Circle soon comes looking for this prospective candidate. Another good possibility is a character who has destroyed a village whose peasants dared to clear a wood for use as farmland.
\par \tab A Shadowed One spies on the potential me
mber for a few weeks or months, often using animal spies as additional eyes. If the druid's deeds and words seem in sympathy with the Shadow Circle's goals, the character receives a visit from this Shadowed One (or a pair for a candidate 11th level or hig
her) before the next Shadowclave. The Shadowed One explains the group's purposes, inviting the newcomer to join. Of course, druids who refuse--or even waver--coincidentally turn up dead shortly thereafter.
\par \tab Candidates who agree to join are blindfolded, give
n a mask, and taken to the Shadowclave. There the Shadowmaster gives each a secret name. After receiving their sworn allegiance, the Shadowmaster formally welcomes the new members into the Shadow Circle and commands them to perform some symbolic but dange
rous task to prove their ruthlessness and dedication. (The difficulty of the assignment depends on the character's experience level.)
\par \tab This kind of mission usually involves assassinating a specific enemy of the Shadow Circle, such as a noble or priest in a 
city the group has targeted for destruction. However, the task might be physically much simpler-- say, poisoning a town well. The Shadowed One who recruited the druid will follow along (secretly), ready to slay a newcomer who shows weakness, risks capture
, or tries to betray the group. Those who succeed, the Shadow Circle embraces as full members.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf13\cgrid0 Creating a Druidic History
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 
\par \tab The druidic order and hierarchy presented here are designed to work as a default or base system. Many circles of druids have their own customs, and on many worlds the druidic order has its own unique history that shapes its structure.
\par \tab The DM always should understand the history of the druidic order before beginning a campaign involving druids. A typical Order, like the one this chapte
r has detailed, is an ancient organization whose origin has become lost in the dim reaches of the past.
\par \tab But that doesn't have to be the case. Instead, the druidic order may have an origin alive in history or myth. This background should explain where the 
first druids came from, why they worship Nature (or a specific Nature deity), why they protect the wild, and their purpose in standing at the crossroads between good and evil. The druidic origins might reflect true history, a legend whose truth remains un
certain, or a mixture of both. In any case, the origin tale must have a profound effect on how druids see themselves in the campaign.
\par \tab As an example of how the druidic order springs from a more detailed history, three very different possible beginnings for the druidic order are sketched out below.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 The Exiles
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 The secret founders of the druids were the crew of a spelljamming vessel, long-ago exiles from a world that would not accept their neutrality following the final triumph of evil--or good. (Exile was 
preferable to the fate of the members of the vanquished alignment, however.) The present druidic order traces its legacy to these ancient castaways.
\par \tab As victims of an unbalanced world, the exiles and their descendants and followers vowed to preserve the vo
latile relationship between good and evil in their adopted home. They can see this balance best illustrated by the forces of Nature. In addition to their normal druidic duties, the members of the Order remain on guard against invasion from their ancestors
' home world.
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 The New Faith}{\fs24\cgrid0 
\par \tab 
\par \tab }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 The druids belong to a relatively new faith, founded less than twenty years ago by a charismatic Nature priest. This amazing leader also preached that the older gods constitute only one small aspect of great Nature.
\par \tab Active m
issionary work, the charisma of this founder, and the simplicity of the Order's beliefs draws more and more converts to druidism every day from the old, tired, polytheistic religions. But the largest rival religion considers druidism a threat; its priests
 have convinced the region's rulers to begin persecution of the "godless, troublemaking" druids.
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 The Myth of the Great War
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 Almost two thousand years ago a terrible war broke out between the two mighty guilds of wi
zards--one good and one evil--that controlled great empires. Wizards on both sides vowed to fight until they were utterly triumphant, seeking to purge their rivals from the earth. With fearsome magic and dragon armies they battled for centuries, neither s
ide winning final victory.
\par \tab In the process of their warfare, the wizards wrought vast devastation on the world--forests blazed up, islands sank into the sea, entire races became extinct. Eventually, the great goddess of Nature awakened from her sleep to wit
ness the savage conflict. Shocked by the destruction, the Goddess sent a vision to a single human: the woman who would become the first Grand Druid.
\par \tab Through the vision, this chosen figure saw that she must found a druidic order to preserve the fragile rem
ains of her world's ecology. With the guidance of her goddess, the Order grew in strength until finally it had the power to intervene in the wizard war. The force of young druids pooled their powers and together vanquished the members of both battling gui
lds, transforming the combatants into innocent wild beasts. Once the former wizards--now unable to fathom the concept of good versus evil--slithered, bounded, loped, and crawled off into their ruined habitats, the Order began to heal the world.
\par \tab Since then,
 the druidic order continually works to prevent such destruction from ever occurring again. Druids pledge to make sure the wars of good and evil no longer mar the precious earth. But, the Order also has bitter enemies in the ancient remnants of the guilds
 of warring wizards--those good and evil mages who luckily escaped the fate of their fellows. Each guild claims it had been on the verge of victory and would have won, had druids not interfered.
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 
\par \tab Each of these backgrounds--or one that you, the player might
 create with your DM--provides the druids of a world with a history, a purpose, and some idea of who their enemies might be. Add more details to these options as desired, to explain the Order's triumphs and failures, the history of its relation to other f
aiths, and perhaps the attempts of factions within the druidic order to deviate from its original purpose.

\par }{\b\fs28\cf13\cgrid0 Druidic Faith
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 
\par \tab Druids fit into the hierarchy of a worldwide Order that espouses a well-defined ethos yet grants each member considerable freedom of 
action. This liberty makes druids much more diverse than many other priest classes--reflected in the different druidic branches and kits--as they pursue their shared goals in their own ways.
\par \tab Druids serve the force of Nature and its inherent natural cycles, such as that of birth, growth, death, and rebirth (}{\i\fs24\cgrid0 PH}{\fs24\cgrid0 
, p. 37). Though some druids do choose to worship Nature embodied in a particular god, Nature, as a force, has no specific form or personality. (}{\i\fs24\cgrid0 The Complete Priest's Handbook}{\fs24\cgrid0 , on p. 11, defines a forc
e as a process, natural or unnatural, that influences the world.)
\par \tab The processes of Nature generate magical power its worshipers can tap. Failure to perform the ceremonies and follow the tenets of druidism leads a druid to fall out of touch with Nature and lose spell access, just as other unfaithful priests do.

\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Druids Who Worship Gods
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab Not all druids worship Nature as a force. Some see it personified by a great deity of Nature, often either formless or possessing many forms.
\par \tab The most common manifestation of a druidic Nature deity is that of the Great Goddess--Chauntea and the Earthmother in the Forgotten Realms\'ae setting or Beory in the World of Greyhawk\'ae
 setting, for example. The Great Goddess embodies Nature through multiple avatars that represent her different aspects: a virgin warrior-huntress, an adult mother, and an ancient crone.
\par \tab The Great Goddess sometimes has a Consort (often appearing as an antlered huntsman), the subordinate lord of the hunt, death, and animals. Followers frequently worship both Goddess and Consort as a single power rather than as two deities.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Life after Death
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab Since they see the universe as a cycle or series of cycles, druids tend to believe the life force of a person (especially one who follows t
he druidic faith) is reborn again and again. A being's reincarnation will not remember a former life but may possess a similar personality.
\par \tab All druids believe a person's soul may be reincarnated into an animal instead of a sentient being--yet another reason they revere all the world's creatures.
\par \tab Are the druids correct? That depends on the nature of the DM's universe.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Nature and the Gods
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab Druids differ in their attitudes toward non-Nature gods. Before beginning a new campaign, it's important for you and your DM to establish a circle's position toward other gods. Some possible beliefs include:
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Nature as Supreme.}{\fs24\cgrid0  These druids consider Nature a force beyond mere gods. Other faiths do exist, but they are mere aspects of the greater whole. To worship one of 
them means celebrating just a fragment of Nature (like the thunder, the ocean or death) rather than the whole, as druids do.
\par \tab Most druids in AD&D game worlds use this approach. They believe their own faith is somewhat superior, but do not actively oppose other faiths and may ally themselves with the worshipers of natural, agricultural, or elemental deities.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Nature as Progenitor.}{\fs24\cgrid0  Followers of this philosophy see Nature as an integral part of a pantheon of gods. In this case, druids identify the other gods a
s "children of Nature," perhaps born in some mythic way. For instance, the druids may teach that, in the time before the world, first came formless chaos, and out of it emerged Nature. From Nature was born the Great Goddess, who married the Sky and gave b
irth to many children: all the other gods.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Nature by Another Name.}{\fs24\cgrid0  Druids may identify Nature as one aspect of an existing god--usually a powerful and primal earth or natural deity. For instance, if the DM wants druids in a fantasy world involving the gods
 of Greek myth, Nature may be worshiped as the great earth goddess Gaia without causing other changes in druidic behavior. This belief pattern enables the druids to participate directly in a pantheon of deities.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Nature is All.}{\fs24\cgrid0  Other gods do not exist! Dru
ids who hold this belief see other priests either as deluded or worshiping Nature under a different name. Unless the druids are right, (in which case, no other class of priest would function in the campaign!) this philosophy leads them to have a rather cl
o
se-minded and inflexible faith. Druids may live apart from mainstream society as hermits or work as missionaries to recruit people to the "one true faith." Quite possibly, believers in other faiths would take a dim view of such druids, as no one likes to 
hear their beliefs called lies!
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 The Gods Threaten Nature.}{\fs24\cgrid0  Other gods are acknowledged as powerful entities, but the druids consider them }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 unnatural}{\fs24\cgrid0 
-- interlopers from the outer planes or beings and philosophies created by the belief of foolish mortals. Foll
owers of aggressive, proselytizing religions that actively seek converts and start religious wars become dangers to the natural order. Druids with this belief tend to act hostile to those of most other faiths, considering them instruments of "outside infl
uences" that threaten the balance of Nature!
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Nature as Equal with Other Forces.}{\fs24\cgrid0  These druids believe that other primal forces exist on the same level as Nature, such as Magic or Entropy. The priests of these forces may become either rivals or allies to druids.

\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf13\cgrid0 The Neutral Alignment}{\fs24\cgrid0 
\par 
\par \tab True neutral, the most misunderstood of all alignments, often causes problems for players. One common mistake is for neutral characters, such as druids, to seek a balance by deliberately acting chaotic evil one day and lawful 
good the next. Such behavior makes characters unpredictable, and the cumulative effect promotes chaos more than anything else.
\par \tab Druids consider each alignment equally valid in a cosmic sense. They try to remain nonjudgmental and uncommitted to any specific
 moral, legal, or philosophical system beyond the basic tenets of the druidic order. Because a druid's main charges--plants, animals, and the health of the planetary ecology--essentially lack alignment or ethos, the character feels free to use almost any 
means necessary to protect them.
\par \tab Chapter 4 of the }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 Player's Handbook}{\fs24\cgrid0  discusses alignments in a general sense; the druidic order works to maintain the natural balance among these alignments. (See "Keeper of the Balance" l
ater in this chapter.) However, druids do realize that most individuals actions--including their own--will not prove significant to the cosmic balance. The druid sees the friction between alignments as the driving force in the world. Although most druids 
personally may }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 prefer}{\fs24\cgrid0  to live among good people, they recognize that the existence of evil keeps intelligent beings from stagnating.
\par \tab Despite their neutral status, druids don't resent being pulled into the struggle between alignments. Neutral individuals do }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 not}{\fs24\cgrid0 
 lack interest, ambition, or passion--they value their own well-being and that of friends and loved ones. They may struggle passionately on behalf of themselves and others, as well as feel a compassion blanketing everything that makes up the Nature the
y swear to protect. Never doubt that druids will act for their own goals and the Order's.
\par \tab For example, the druid Rebecca has no philosophical objection to helping a group of lawful good paladins and clerics defeat an evil dragon--if they can demonstrate a
 good reason. She won't agree to kill the dragon merely "because it is evil." But, she might help if the dragon had harmed or threatened her friends or a forest or village under her protection. She might also offer assistance simply because she realizes t
h
e danger of living near a powerful and unpredictably evil creature inclined to wreak havoc upon the natural surroundings. Finally, she might join the party in return for a pledge that the members aid her in protecting a wilderness area from those who woul
d exploit it--or in order to get treasure and magical items to do the job on her own.
\par \tab Clearly, playing a druid true to alignment is no easy task. The character must consider carefully all the variables in a situation before acting. Remember that, when face
d with a tough decision, a druid usually stands behind the solution that best serves Nature }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 in the long run.}{\fs24\cgrid0 
 So, Rebecca could have an equally valid reason to join a band of evil adventurers hunting a lawful good dragon as she has to join a good party hunt
ing an evil dragon. Although a gold or silver dragon is unlikely to threaten Rebecca or her sacred grove, she might wish to use its treasure to purchase equipment to fight a greater threat or win the trust of an evil party she can use for her own ends.

\par \tab Of
 course, druids understand that others may not take so pragmatic a view. Rebecca knows a party of adventurers wouldn't be pleased to find she has stymied its efforts. Alignment struggles constitute just another aspect of Nature, so Rebecca would never see
k to stop the members of a party from continuing the struggle unless she deems it harmful to her own interests or those of the force she worships and safeguards.
\par \tab A druid allied with a party of adventurers usually goes along with the party's actions unless 
they threaten trees, crops, wild plants, and other things the druid holds sacred. At the same time, the character needs a reason for joining a party--often something as simple as a desire to gain the experience and power needed to become a more effective 
guardian of Nature.
\par \tab Druids tend to react nonjudgmentally toward other races. With the possible exception of undead, they feel that every race and species has its place in the world. For instance, a druid recognizes most orcs as evil and cruel. The characte
r might not enjoy the company of orcs, but doesn't consider this feeling an excuse to exterminate the entire race. Conflict between orcs and humans is the way of the world, some druids say. They point out that orcs live a harsher existence than humans, of
ten dwelling in the deadly subterranean world. And, while the average human may be less cruel than the average orc, mankind is capable of greater evil through superior organization and civilization.
\par \tab Druids who stray from their alignment or cease to follow 
the tenets of the Order lose major sphere spell access and granted powers until they make atonement. In addition, the circle's great druid may place any subordinate druid under the ban as a temporal punishment for such violations.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf13\cgrid0 A Druid's Responsibilities
\par 
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
The beliefs and ethics of druids cover two main areas: keeping the balance between the alignments and serving as guardians of Nature. When role-playing a druid character, keep in mind that the character's behavior should reflect the importance of thes
e duties.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Keeper of the Balance
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab Druids have seen that a balance between the forces of good and evil, law and chaos, best fosters the continuance of life from one generation to the next. This druidic duty is not so much a personal matter as the ethical 
responsibility of the entire Order.
\par \tab Only an event or threat of considerable magnitude can cause the balance to tilt toward one alignment or another--a matter that could affect the destiny of nations. Deciding that a menace of this degree exists and how be
st to handle it is traditionally left to those of archdruid or higher rank, or the High Council of the Moot. However, lesser druid PCs may decide they know better and take action on their own!
\par \tab Remember, keeping a balance doesn't spell stagnation. Druids v
iew a slight shift in the balance--like the ascendancy of one alignment--to be as natural as a change in the weather. An individual druid may prefer a period of good (or of law) just as one might prefer a warm summer day. But autumn and winter remain just
 as necessary--in a world of eternal summer, the autumn harvest never comes.
\par \tab But druids also believe in free will, and with free will comes the danger that the balance will tilt too far in one direction. Many druids believe--rightly or wrongly-- that power
ful beings (gods and extraplanar entities) manipulate mortals for just such an end: to see their own alignment or faith permanently triumphant.
\par \tab When druids perceive the balance tilting too far in any direction, the Order becomes concerned. Some individual
 members may profess that the balance will swing back by itself, regardless of the actions of mankind. Such druids contentedly sit back and let events pass without taking action. A druid with this belief would not make an interesting PC, although such a m
indset gives the DM a good excuse to have senior druids refuse to aid the player character!
\par \tab But most druids do not share this belief. The majority see human and demihuman races in general and the druidic order in particular as pivotal to maintaining the co
smic balance. They look at the cycles of the world as driven by the actions and machinations of mankind (and other intelligent races) and believe that, as individuals play their part in the great cycle, they can also upset it.
\par \tab This means that, when the co
smic balance is obviously in danger of being tilted in favor of one alignment or faith, druids will ally themselves (openly or covertly) with the opposing side. Normally an archdruid or great druid makes this decision and devotes all energies to rallying 
t
he circle against the threat. Sometimes a circle of druids becomes divided about the situation: Is it serious enough to warrant intervention? The circle leaves it up to individual druids to decide whether to offer assistance. However, keep in mind that dr
uids who frequently refuse to aid their circle's cause will find themselves unable to attract help from senior druids when they need it.
\par \tab Although the balance could swing too far in any direction, DMs should set their campaigns at times when }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 evil}{\fs24\cgrid0  has grown 
alarmingly in strength, for such periods allow druid PCs to become heroes. With the balance threatened by the power of evil, most druids find themselves in the position to serve the cause of good willingly. This motivation is good for the game, as it prov
ides plenty of adventure for good-aligned PCs while giving druids a chance to fight by their sides.
\par \tab Similarly, in a game featuring the PCs as rebels or outlaws against authority, the balance may have swung in favor of inflexible law. In such a case, druids
 may side with the forces of chaos--good, neutral, and maybe even evil--in the struggle of liberty against oppression.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Defense of the Wilderness
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab The second major responsibility of druid characters is to defend the wilderness and its wildlife. Players s
ometimes feel uncertain as to the limits of a druid's concern for Nature, especially in regard to how druids treat those who make a living hunting or farming.
\par \tab 
Since all druids are charged with protecting natural wilderness, trees, wild plants, wild animals, and crops, they also protect the people who follow druidic beliefs, such as peasants and hunters living in harmony with Nature. (See the Guardian and Villag
e Druid kits, Chapter 2.)
\par \tab Druids realize all creatures have basic needs for food, shelter, and self-defense. Humans must hunt animals for food and must clear trees to farm and build houses. These actions constitute a necessary part of the natural cycle. Bu
t druids do not tolerate unnecessary destruction or exploitation of Nature. Sensing violations, a druid investigates the motives of the people involved, weighing them against the risk to the land. Then the druid decides whether to take action.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Protecting Animals.}{\fs24\cgrid0 
 Only a very few druids (like those with the Pacifist kit) oppose hunting or raising animals for food, skins, or fur. In fact, many druids hunt animals for food and clothing themselves. They do frown upon killing animals simply for sport, over-hunt
ing (or over-trapping) a region, and treating animals with excessive cruelty. And most druids do not even take this feeling to extremes. They know that feudal nobles, for instance, enjoy the hunt; few such hunters are cruel killers, and their game ends up
 on the lord's tables.
\par \tab Druids oppose trapping or hunting beasts to use their fur or other body parts for frivolous reasons. A hunter may kill a single wolf and take its pelt to make a wolfskin cloak, according to druidic philosophy. If the hunter kills a c
ouple wolves every year and sells their pelts, a druid may or may not be upset, depending on the prevalence of wolves in the area. But if a hunter regularly traps dozens of wolves and makes a fortune selling their pelts to local merchants, a druid will be
come angry and take action.
\par \tab Even more than trapping for food or fur, druids hate to see animals captured for use in events like bear baiting, bullfighting, or other such "sports." Druids always try to stop these spectacles and free the animals. They may wr
eak terrible vengeance on those who capture wild beasts for sport or operate the arenas where animals are forced to fight.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Protecting Trees and Woodlands.}{\fs24\cgrid0  Druids have nothing against most forms of farming, even if it means clearing woodlands or draining s
wamps to create new fields. Although druids feel a special reverence for trees, crops are plants too, and civilized races have a right to practice agriculture.
\par \tab The druid may object to destroying a wilderness area for a farm extension that is strictly for 
profit. For instance, clearing a forest for a large plantation to grow cash crops--especially ones intended for pleasure, such as tobacco--would raise a druid's ire.
\par \tab A druid also will oppose farming that requires the destruction of ancient wilderness area
s, large spreads of land, or any region that serves as a sanctuary for rare, endangered, or magical plants and animals. Most importantly, no druid ever tolerates the destruction of a sacred grove! Druids also discourage farming practices that harm the soi
l and selfish irrigation schemes (dams, aqueducts, etc.) intended to parch one region to slake another's thirst.
\par \tab Druids sometimes tolerate logging or clearing land to mine useful minerals like salt, copper, tin, and iron. After all, they use manufactured i
tems themselves. Whether to accept such land use depends on the motives and need of those involved and the nature of the region in question, just as with farming.
\par \tab Cutting down a forest to build houses is one thing--especially if the builder makes some eff
ort at replanting. Using the wood to build a fleet of warships to satisfy the ambitions of a tyrant is much less likely to find sympathy with the druid. On the other hand, if the proposed fleet will oppose the invasion force of a king whose conquests thre
aten to tip the balance of good and evil, some druids may justify the forest's loss.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Cleansing Nature.}{\fs24\cgrid0  Some acts defile the very essence of Nature and require immediate opposition. For instance, the magical forced transformation of a large forest into a bi
zarre, otherplanar landscape instantly draws the enmity of the circle. If a sacred grove falls under a curse, druids will work to lift it and reclaim the land.
\par \tab A more common perversion of Nature is the undead. The fact that no druidic branch has the power to turn or control undead does }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 not}{\fs24\cgrid0 
 mean druids tolerate them. Rather, the druid's lack of power over the living dead reflects the absolute aversion this class has toward them. Things exist in a natural cycle: birth, growth, death, rebirth. The undead brea
k this cycle--worse, they are the enemies of life. Therefore, most druids see the undead as abominations to stamp out to restore the proper workings of Nature.
\par \tab Yet, druids do not actively hunt undead. This is primarily because undead rarely directly invad
e a druid's sphere of interest. However, if a vampire starts menacing a peaceful village, a banshee begins stalking the moors, or a lich introduces a reign of terror to the wilderness, a druid may intervene. Because druids lack the key powers necessary to
 fight undead (although their elemental magic can prove useful), they will ally with a good-aligned party also interested in wiping out the undead.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Defending Croplands and Farmers.}{\fs24\cgrid0  A druid feels an obligation to protect farmers who worship Nature and to sa
feguard fields and livestock. For details, see the Village Druid kit (Chapter 2) and the "festivals" section in this chapter.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Eyes in the Wilderness
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab Defending an entire tract of wilderness and safeguarding the balance of forces within it spells a }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 lot}{\fs24\cgrid0  o
f work for one druid. (In addition, sometimes druids are asked to give reports on their section of the domain at moots.) Clearly, to do a good job, the druid needs reliable sources of information and early knowledge of possible threats.
\par \tab Druids' own powers
 do go a long way in keeping them aware of the goings-on in and near their area. The ability to pass without a trace and blend into the woods allows druids to maintain watch on anyone entering the wild. Even better is their shapechange power. Druids risk 
d
etection when using it, but very few people--unless they know they have a druidic enemy--ever would suspect that a spy lurks in the form of the mangy hound munching a bone under the lord's table or the cat hiding under the bed. To infiltrate a foe's stron
ghold, druids often assume the shape of a domestic animal, allowing themselves to be bought at market or given as a gift--although those shapechanging into an edible animal should take care to avoid the stew pot!
\par \tab At high levels, the ability to cast }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 speak with plants}{\fs24\cgrid0  or }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 stone tell}{\fs24\cgrid0 
 proves very useful. If the druid is looking for general information, good recipients for such a spell include trees or standing stones at crossroads, at wells, or near town or castle gates.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Animal Aides.}{\fs24\cgrid0  Still, druids can be in only one place at a time. In addition to their own powers, they also use animal resources. }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 Speak with animals}{\fs24\cgrid0 
 gives druids an ability enemies always regret underestimating.
\par \tab Druids rely on animals mostly in the wild: a spread of furry, feathered, and scaly "
spies" all over the land to keep watch on the movements of friends and enemies alike. Normally, small, inconspicuous animals work best--especially birds, with their excellent mobility, aerial vantage point, and good eyesight. Rodents, from squirrels to mi
ce, rarely get noticed. Domestic animals constitute another good choice due to their intelligence. They have the added bonus of being able to tell the druid about the activities inside a building.
\par \tab To this end, a druid who can speak with animals should use every opportunity to insinuate these aides into important areas, such as the lord's stronghold--perhaps a character can even covertly cast }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 animal friendship}{\fs24\cgrid0 
 (or better, }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 charm person}{\fs24\cgrid0  or }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 mammal}{\fs24\cgrid0 ) on a foe's animals. Some individuals may protect their servants from }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 charm}{\fs24\cgrid0 , but few think to check domestic animals.

\par \tab One problem with using animals kept inside a building involves the difficulty of staying in touch with them. Animal helpers should have an opportunity to slip out to meet the druid (like a cat that is 
put out at night) or should remain in magical contact with the druid. (See the }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 animal spy}{\fs24\cgrid0 
 spell in Chapter 5: Druidic Magic.) With this logistical problem solved, domestic animal spies can prove exceedingly effective. People may search high and low to discover a traitor, never dreaming that traitor is actually a falcon, pet dog, or war horse!

\par \tab Animals have a limitation, though: They often don't understand what they see and hear and sometimes can't determine what is worth reporting. A dog can recognize certa
in people and usually has a general idea what its owners are doing, but it cannot understand speech. A mouse or bat probably cannot tell one person from another. Animals can tell druids of unusual events, like the passage of a large body of men. They can 
w
arn druids when people have entered or left buildings or mention when a new monster appears. But, for detailed and reliable intelligence, the druid needs just that: intelligent spies. To this end, all druids should make use of the eyes and ears of other i
nhabitants of the wilderness.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Human and Demihuman Assets.}{\fs24\cgrid0 
 Druids who have lived in an area for a long time should cultivate friendly contacts among the surrounding manors and villages. If the people openly follow druidism, they generally inform the druid o
f unusual happenings as a matter of course. Otherwise, druids try to place one "agent" in each village or castle in their area; low-ranking servants often have reason to go into the wilds every now and then (chopping firewood, grazing the animals, etc.), 
giving them an excuse to secretly meet the druid. Some druids befriend children for this purpose, since no one will miss them when they go out to play, nor will most people suspect children of passing information.
\par \tab Druids try to keep in touch with a friend 
at every roadside and village inn within their territory. This source isn't necessarily the innkeeper: Someone less obvious, like a servant or stablekeeper, works better. Since adventurers and other interesting travelers usually stop at inns, the source c
an update druids on newcomers.
\par \tab The druid must contact these aides regularly to advise them of the sort of information they should look for and receive their news. Just as important as having agents is having a means of collecting updates from them, after all. The 2nd-level }{
\i\fs24\cgrid0 messenger}{\fs24\cgrid0 
 spell suits this purpose ideally. Innkeepers and the like tend to stay terribly busy, so providing them with a trained messenger animal (often a bird) can ensure periodic reports. If the agent (or druid) cannot read or write, th
e pair can arrange a simple code: a red ribbon on the bird's foot means, "Come immediately," a blue ribbon means, "Interesting strangers staying at the inn."
\par \tab A druid's agents almost never work professionally as spies, an
d few know much about the druid's doings (helpful, if an enemy questions them). Most are just ordinary (0-level) men and women. Druids don't have to reveal their identity to these contacts--they just use their natural charm (Charisma of 15 or better) to a
p
pear as romantic, mysterious figures who will pay well if kept informed of local gossip. Just as often, druids recruit from among those who are in their debt. For instance, a druid who used magic to save a child from disease might recruit the grateful mot
her as another set of eyes. Also, druids utilize members of families that have followed the druidic faith for generations (often in secret). Finally, druids do not hesitate to use }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 charm person}{\fs24\cgrid0  or }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 mammal}{
\fs24\cgrid0  to create excellent involuntary spies when necessary!
\par \tab 
Besides these local folk, druids should also strive to be on good terms with travelers like tinkers, Gypsies, bards, merchants, entertainers, and rangers. These people, often the first to bear news from the next county, always know what the neighbors are 
talking about. Being on "good terms" usually requires making friends with a few prominent members of these groups and offering magical assistance at times.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Sylvan Creatures.}{\fs24\cgrid0  Elves, satyrs, dryads, treants, sylphs, and similar native creatures represent a 
priceless resource every druid should cultivate to the utmost. Their special powers and ability to blend into the wilderness make them excellent scouts. In addition, their goals usually parallel those of the druid--the protection of the woodlands and wild
erness--so their information likely will prove timely and reliable. A character tends to receive a more regular flow of gossip by befriending }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 particular}{\fs24\cgrid0 
 sylvan beings--make friends with Shaylara the Pixie rather than just staying on good terms with a "band 
of pixies." To foster this comradeship, the druid should often visit the dwellings of local pixies, sprites, elves, and the like, and always stand ready to offer help, such as magical }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 cures }{\fs24\cgrid0 
or protection from adventurers or monsters.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Humanoids and Evil Monsters. }{\fs24\cgrid0 
Druid characters should not forget that their neutral alignment enables them to make use of all sorts of information sources. Those who live near a monster and stay on speaking terms with it sometimes receive a messenger with information from the c
reature--which undoubtedly hopes for a favor or bribe. This relationship generally requires that the druid first win the monster's trust: by providing food in a harsh winter, using magic to heal injuries, etc.
\par \tab However, druids must use the stick along with
 the carrot--most evil creatures prove truly helpful only after the character demonstrates the fury of druidic wrath! Even so, humanoids and monsters usually feel happy to alert the druid if something mysterious is making them uneasy--or if }{
\i\fs24\cgrid0 good}{\fs24\cgrid0  forces are infiltrating the wilderness.
\par \tab Remember, evil creatures are notorious liars: They will tell the druid only what suits them. A tribe of forest-dwelling goblins attacked and routed by two high-level rangers and a paladin might warn the druid of these intrude
rs--after changing some details of their encounter with ". . . dozens of human warriors! We got many, but they were too much powerful. We see them chop down tree . . ." }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 Caveat emptor}{\fs24\cgrid0 .
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Druidic Ceremonies
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab Besides protecting the wilderness and maintaining
 the cosmic balance, druidic responsibilities include worshiping Nature through the appropriate ceremonies. This duty also involves casting spells and presiding over rites, many of which involve the use of the druids' secret language. (See Chapter 1.) Oth
er ceremonies benefit the druid's flock--those rural folk who worship Nature (or a Nature deity) and follow the druidic ethos. The exact rituals vary from circle to circle and branch to branch, but all druids practice the common ones, including:
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Prayers}{\fs24\cgrid0 . D
ruids almost always pray in the form of poems or songs celebrating the beauty and power of Nature and the druid's role in it. These poems are valued as much for the beauty of their language and imagery as for their ritual value; dual-class bard/druids cre
ated some of the most memorable ones. A druid should create new prayers after personal inspiration. Many prayers celebrate a specific aspect of Nature, such as the beginning of spring, and are sung, chanted, or spoken only certain days.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Wild Dancing.}{\fs24\cgrid0  The c
eremonies of druids--especially younger initiates--often involve dancing. The movements, rarely formal or ritualized, are wild, impulsive, individual, and ecstatic--a spontaneous celebration of Nature's energy. Druids may dance while praying to regain spe
lls; although in motion, the druid remains in deep communion with the powers of Nature during the dance, as oblivious to the rest of the world as if deep in study.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Holy Days.}{\fs24\cgrid0  Like other priests, druids offer brief prayers one or more times a day, but they 
also have holidays in which they devote the entire day (or night) to sacred ceremonies. Druids typically spend two full days every month observing the holy days of their particular branch and of the Order as a whole. Minor celebrations usually take place 
in accordance with the lunar calendar; on the highly important first days of the full moon and new moon, most druids hold daylong or nightlong rites, either on their own or in the company of other druids.
\par \tab Even more important are those ceremonies held four 
times a year to celebrate the changing of the seasons. At such times, an archdruid or the great druid summons most druids in the circle together for a great moot. Initiations and challenges often, but not always, occur at these times.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Festivals.}{\fs24\cgrid0  Festivals
 are holy days celebrated not just by druids but by the entire community. If a village or tribe openly follows the druidic philosophy, some or all the seasonal rites include a joyous public festival. Druids praise Nature and bless the village, livestock, 
and crops. Then, with the locals, they sing, dance, and make merry for the rest of the day around a tree or Maypole in the village green.
\par \tab Following the day of celebration, the assemblage builds bonfires on the hills to ward off evil, enjoys performances by
 visiting bards, and watches locals dressed as animals dance to ensure good hunting. Springtime rites, the most important, end with the casting of }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 plant growth}{\fs24\cgrid0  on the fields to guarantee their fertility come harvest time.

\par \tab Private rites involving only the druids usually follow a festival--often late at night.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Appeasement.}{\fs24\cgrid0  Druids, while they do not always object to replacing wilderness with cropland, insist on performing a ceremony before any land is cleared. These rites, designed to appease, comfort, and l
ay to rest the spirits of the trees and plants about to be cut down, normally require a druid's presence for half a day per acre of wilderness slated for clearing. In some cases, a druid high enough in level casts a }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 commune with nature}{
\fs24\cgrid0  spell to determine if permitting the destruction is the right thing to do.
\par \tab A druid unable to perform the rites before the clearing of the land begins will become very upset. At the DM's discretion, this lack of appeasement also may lead to the appearance of creatures such as treants, who seek to avenge the destruction.

\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Rites of Passage.}{\fs24\cgrid0  A young person coming of age usually undergoes a rite of passage into adulthood. A druid living among the local folk administers this usually secret rite, which may involve anything from a sp
iritual revelation to a painful ordeal, depending on the culture.
\par \tab For example, the druid, after invoking a blessing, might lead the candidate into the deep woods, then leave the adolescent to find the way home. Along the way, the druid may appear in shape
changed forms to act as a guide. Candidates who make it out of the woods (very likely, unless they ignore or mistreat their animal guides) are considered adults from that day forward. If they guess that the druid had been watching over them in animal form
, they may find their destiny lies in a druidic career.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Marriages.}{\fs24\cgrid0  Druids perform marriage ceremonies for locals under their spiritual care, usually simple affairs in a druid's grove or village green. There, the man and woman share vows to love, respect, a
nd protect one another, with the druid serving as witness. Following the vows comes an exchange of tokens, prayers for the couple's health and fertility, and finally a party and feast.
\par \tab Druids themselves, rarely celibate, usually choose to marry and raise 
children. Some circles prefer their druids to limit their choice to "suitable" mates: druids or bards, and perhaps elves, dryads, or sylphs. Independent rural folk like tinkers, rangers, Gypsies, or foresters also constitute good choices. Love can be blin
d, but a druid generally prefers a mate of neutral alignment, from a rural background, who follows the druidic faith.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Funerals. }{\fs24\cgrid0 Most druids bury their dead (although some prefer cremation), returning the bod
y of a loved one to the earth near a sacred grove. Mourners celebrate the deceased through poems and prayers, and a hired bard may offer additional memorials in song. Finally, the presiding druid blesses the departed spirit and--since most druids believe 
in reincarnation--prays for its safe rebirth. Friends and family then hold a wake to remember the departed person through song, dance, and merrymaking.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Initiations.}{\fs24\cgrid0  Worthy aspirants seeking to enter the druidic order must be initiated by an inner circle me
mber. The initiation takes place at a moot or in a sacred grove on a holy day. The candidate, after being purified with holy water, takes the druidic oath: a promise to preserve the balance of the world, to follow the druidic ethos, to respect the freedom
 of other druids in and beyond the circle, to act as a guardian of Nature (or the deity that personifies Nature to the Order), and to live true to the druidic order and keep its secrets safe.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf13\cgrid0 Character Strategy
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 
\par \tab Exactly }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 how}{\fs24\cgrid0  do druids go about fulfilling t
he responsibilities discussed above? In role-playing terms, there are some interesting strategies you, the player, can use to make the most of your druid character's potential.
\par \tab Suppose the druid Dannay wished to preserve an old wood, but the local baron and his peasants want it cut down, claiming they need the land to plant crops to keep from going hungry. What does the druid do?
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Find the Root of the Problem
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab First, Dannay must determine the truth of the situation--what lies behind the decision to chop 
down the wood? Are the peasants really in need or just greedy? Is their lord simply attempting to increase his own income? Why are the peasants likely to starve? Is there any other land to plant?
\par \tab After investigating, Dannay decides the peasants do have a 
legitimate need to develop the old wood. Next, he considers the threatened trees themselves. Is the woodland ancient? (Druids prefer to preserve the eldest trees.) Does it harbor species of rare animals or plants? Will its destruction displace sylvan race
s? Is this forest one of the few unspoiled areas left in the region? Does a sacred grove lie within the forest? All these, particularly the last, constitute good reasons for a druid to take a stand opposing the destruction of the wood.
\par \tab Assume that, for one of these reasons, Dannay finds this wood of ancient oak worth preserving. In most cases he first seeks a peaceful compromise.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Negotiate a Solution
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab For instance, if the area possesses no other available land, Dannay might show the peasants that expansi
on isn't necessary. Say the peasants' problem is that their current crops don't yield enough to feed them and cover their tithes. Dannay might offer his services as an adviser if the lord agrees to lower the peasants' taxes. If the baron refuses--or alrea
dy levies merely reasonable taxes--the druid could try to help directly.
\par \tab How should Dannay help? As an expert in agriculture, he can suggest techniques to increase the yield of the peasants' current crops so they don't require expansion. Or he might make a
 bargain: In exchange for the peasants agreeing not to encroach on the wood, he will use druidic magic to cure (or prevent) disease among their animals, or heal sick villagers and livestock. High-level druids could promise to control the weather to extend
 the growing season or to prevent droughts or floods. Most useful of all, a druid with access to the 3rd-level spell }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 plant growth}{\fs24\cgrid0  can increase the prosperity of any farm dramatically.
\par \tab But suppose the idea of a compromise does not meet with favor. Maybe the
 peasants have a priest of their own who already provides this sort of magical aid. Perhaps they follow a religion that distrusts druids. Maybe the baron has determined to expand his land at all costs--or perhaps he just doesn't like a druid telling him w
hat to do! In any event, Dannay may have to turn to harsher measures. Exactly what he does depends on his assessment of the strength and character of the opposition and the importance of the wilds in question.
\par \tab Several options make themselves available when negotiation fails. Many call for the druid, short of destroying an enemy, to break that enemy's morale instead.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Ultimatum
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab Dannay could simply announce to the peasants and lord, "Violate my wood, and you will regret it." This threat may work for prestigious druids; it also may prove successful if backed up with a flashy demonstration, like a }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 
wall of thorns}{\fs24\cgrid0  around a portion of the threatened wood or a }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 call lightning}{\fs24\cgrid0  spell in the midst of the speech.
\par \tab The DM should judge the effect of the ultimatum depend
ing on the alignment of the NPCs involved, how desperately they want the land, and the reputation and actions of the druid. Most likely the lord and peasants will not be so easily cowed, and Dannay will have to turn to direct action.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Harassment
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab The dru
id could choose to use passive, nonviolent resistance to prevent the leveling of the wood. Suppose a party of lumberjacks enters to begin work. Dannay could have enchanted plants entangle or snare them, order chipmunks and squirrels to steal their food, c

\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Fear
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab Alternately, Dannay might try to convince the l
ocals that the wood is haunted; he wants them to stay out just for their own safety. Even if the wood was previously safe, the druid may convince the peasants that their intentions to cut it down have awakened ancient wood spirits ready to rise against an
y intruders.
\par \tab Careful use of spells like }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 faerie fire}{\fs24\cgrid0  and }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 dust devil}{\fs24\cgrid0  can simulate ghosts; }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 obscurement}{\fs24\cgrid0  makes mysterious mists; }{\i\fs24\cgrid0

ike an erected gallows with a human skull or two lying around in the wood strike terror into the hearts of peasants and common soldiers alike.
\par \tab Naturally, some people will suspect Dannay is behind this, especially if he tried negotiating with the locals and lord earlier. So, some druids simply use fear tactics }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 before}{\fs24\cgrid0  attempting a compromise!
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Hit-and-Run
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab A ruthless druid facing a determined foe may combine fear with violent actions, such as killing intruders and leaving their bodies for others to find or
 just allowing the victims to vanish without a trace. This technique can prove very effective, especially when the deaths are mysterious and not directly traceable to the druid's magic. But Dannay should be wary of doing the job too well: Misleading the n
atives into believing that murderous undead roam the wood, for instance, may lead them to call upon outsider paladins or clerics to purge the area.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Defense
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab Dannay may decide merely to defend his land aggressively, attacking anyone who enters the wood. D
ruids frequently resort to a defensive stance when fear or harassment fail. The character aims to convince intruders exploitation is too costly to be worthwhile. The druid's tactics resemble a more violent form of harassment. In particular, Dannay would m
obilize native creatures (using }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 animal friendship}{\fs24\cgrid0  and sometimes }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 animal growth}{\fs24\cgrid0 
 spells) to attack intruders and--if he has time--would set lethal traps, such as pits and deadfalls. The druid also may recruit allies, perhaps other druids or monsters who could lose their lairs to the axe.
\par \tab Like many good generals, Dannay himself often stays back from the fighting, instead setting up magical traps and sending animals and plants into battle. Normally a druid would risk himself to save an animal, but in this case h
e is battling not just for one creature, but for an entire habitat. Dannay knows he must spare his own life so he can continue to preserve the lives of others.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 War
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab Usually as a last resort, the druid may choose to carry the fight to the enemy's castle 
or village. Typically, only a high-level druid has the ability to do this. And remember, Dannay has no obligation to use "honorable" tactics. If he has chosen to fight, it is because he believes his opponents have failed to compromise.
\par \tab A druid's actions i
n war may range from subtle tricks, like stealing some or all the local plow animals and war horses, to something direct but nonviolent, like shapechanging into a bird, sneaking into the offending lord's bedchamber, and taking his first-born hostage for h
is good behavior. Or, Dannay could use spells like }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 call lightning, conjure fire elemental, creeping doom}{\fs24\cgrid0 , or }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 earthquake}{\fs24\cgrid0  to wreak destruction. Even low-level spells like }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 
produce flame}{\fs24\cgrid0  can easily set fire to a peasant's cottage or a field of grain.
\par \tab Please no
te that Dannay will direct his every action solely against those who cause the problem. If a greedy baron represents the threat to the wood, the druid targets the baron. If the problem lies with the peasants, he tries to intimidate them or drive them away
. A druid never engages in wanton violence for its own sake.
\par \tab When a PC druid uses any of these strategies, the DM should work out the response of the factions opposing the druid's interests. For instance, perhaps the baron sends up to three village work pa
rties daily into the wood, each of which can clear one acre of forest if allowed to work unimpeded. If the druid decides to harass them or frighten them off, the DM should refer to the rules for morale and NPC reactions (}{\i\fs24\cgrid0 DMG}{
\fs24\cgrid0 , pgs. 69-72, 114-115) and make 
morale checks any time the druid succeeds with an action the DM deems would frustrate, impede, or frighten them. If a work party fails enough checks, the workers either get nothing done that day or return home, too scared to come back. Perhaps soldiers or
 the lord's mage escort the next work parties. If Dannay succeeds in dealing with this new threat, the DM may wish to check the }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 baron's}{\fs24\cgrid0  morale. Failing this check, the baron may negotiate.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Revenge
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab A druid who has failed to stop the defilement of Nature 
often seeks vengeance, for one of three reasons. First, the druid removes his foe to make sure the defilement doesn't happen again. Second, a druid's act of revenge sends a message to others. And third, as most druids are human, they can succumb to anger 
and feelings of injustice as easily as anyone else.
\par \tab Vengeful druids must consider this question carefully: Who is the intended object of revenge? For example, a druid may immediately target as foes trappers massacring winter wolf cubs for their fur. But, u
pon investigation, the druid discovers that the trappers are merely poor yeomen or peasants simply trying to earn money to support their families. The real enemies become the gentleman furriers who grow rich off the sale of the pelts, and the lords and la
dies who demand winter wolf fur as this year's high fashion. The druid should take revenge on these people.
\par \tab A character seeking vengeance will wait patiently and make careful plans. This behavior sometimes makes them seem cold-blooded, but the druid has a long memory--a foe who appears too strong today may prove weaker tomorrow.
\par \tab Druids prefer subtle forms of vengeance. If a wicked sheriff were responsible for the destruction of a druid's grove, the druid might try to frame the sheriff for treason against h
is lord rather than risk a direct attack. For the sheriff to be executed as a traitor would be a fitting revenge!
\par \tab Some druids enjoy irony. Suppose a noble cleared an ancient forest to set up a vineyard. After the first pressing, a druid might sneak into the wine cellar and spoil the vintage.
\par \tab A druid carefully considers the consequences of an act of vengeance and works them into the overall plan. For instance, if a king's sheriff were the druid's enemy, the druid would not try to destroy the sheriff withou
t knowing what would happen afterward. In particular, the druid would not try to destroy an enemy who might be replaced with an even worse foe. Instead, the druid might take vengeance in a different form--perhaps by kidnaping the sheriff's infant to raise
 as a druid who one day would prove a foe to the sheriff.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf13\cgrid0 Relations with Others}{\fs24\cgrid0 
\par 
\par \tab Here's how relations often stand between druids and the people and monsters that live in or near the wild.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Woodcutters and Hunters}{\fs24\cgrid0 
\par \tab 
\par \tab Druids act much as game wardens do, letting woodcutters know which trees they may cut and which they must leave standing, and telling hunters which species they may hunt and which are protected.
\par \tab Sometimes these folk resent or even disobey such orders, but
 most druids temper their restrictions with reason and balance punishment with reward. People who live or work in the wild and follow a druid's laws remain under druidic protection. Druids use their spells when necessary to cure injury or sickness in hunt
ers' families, prevent starvation among woodcutters in harsh times, and so on. Those who don't follow druidic rules cannot expect help, even in cases of dire need.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Local Animals
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab Druids try to get to know most wild animals within a few miles of home, lea
rning their daily habits, the locations of their lairs, and so on. A druid makes a point of keeping track of animals that are pregnant, weak, or sick, and usually aids (or puts down) diseased, mad, or injured local creatures. However, a druid does not int
e
rfere with normal cycles of predators and prey. Think of this attitude as that of forest rangers or game wardens: Protecting species holds greater importance than safeguarding individuals. Still, druids often befriend a few local animals, whom they respec
t and protect as they would human companions. Animals frequently serve as a busy druid's eyes and ears.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Sylvan and Faerie Creatures
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab Druids respect certain creatures as sentient embodiments of the "spirit" of Nature. Forest druids, in particular, would r
isk their lives to protect sylvan or faerie beings and would oppose other humans to protect the wilderness where they live. In return, these creatures often give druids official standing in their communities, perhaps as ambassadors to human realms. A drui
d might receive an invitation to speak at a sylvan or faerie council to offer a "human viewpoint," although only rarely would humans extend the same courtesy.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Outlaws, Fugitives, and Bandits
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab Folk living away from society sometimes find themselves operat
ing in the same wilderness areas as druids. As druids know their woods intimately, they can become vital allies--and bitter enemies, for they know exactly where outlaws hide and can lead pursuers to them if they choose. Thus, any outlaws exist on the drui
ds' sufferance.
\par \tab Druids usually prefer to avoid becoming involved with criminals. They sometimes shelter individual fugitives and, rarely, offer assistance to entire bands of outlaws whose activities further druidic goals and show proper respect toward Natu
re. Druids' actions generally depend on the situation.
\par \tab For instance, a character wishing to discourage farmers or loggers from making inroads into a forest might consider an alliance with bandits, while one on good terms with neighboring villagers and nob
ility would seek to drive them away or reveal their location to the law. But most often, the druid remains uninvolved, acting only to protect the wilderness from threats.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Local Monsters
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab Druids usually stay on good or neutral terms with local monsters, 
opposing them only if they threaten the entire area or the druid personally. For instance, a beholder that uses a woodland cave as its sanctuary makes a fine neighbor for a druid; one that tries to enslave large numbers of sylvan folk to conquer a nearby 
elven kingdom means trouble and should be eliminated before it engulfs the forest in a devastating war.
\par \tab In general, the druid will act more favorably to creatures that "belong" in an area. A green dragon, a native of woodlands just as much as an elf or bea
r, finds it only natural to prey on elves and men. A druid has no argument with this tendency. After all, the humans and elves can always send a knight to slay the dragon.
\par \tab Most druids make an effort to stay on speaking terms with intelligent monsters, good, evil, or neutral. The druid may do occasional favors for a creature on a }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 quid pro quo}{\fs24\cgrid0 
 basis. For example, the druid might volunteer to heal a sick or injured monster; the druid wants something in return, like a promise that the beast will refrain from attacking a certain village, will free its captives, or will aid the druid in battle.

\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Evil Humanoids
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab The druid knows these evil humanoid races make up a natural part of t
he world and have a right to struggle for existence. As a result, druids will not act against orcs, goblins, or the like simply because of their race or "evil" nature. In fact, in the eyes of the druids, these races represent less of a threat to the wilde
rness than do humans or dwarves: Few humanoids organize beyond the tribal level, they rarely build big cities above ground, and they prefer hunting and gathering to extensive farming.
\par \tab A few druids--especially Shadow Circle members--ally with native humanoi
ds to protect the wilderness against encroachment or to aid weaker tribes being persecuted for no good reason. However, they make these agreements with care and in utmost secrecy, for they realize the humanoids' evil nature makes them treacherous comrades
. Moreover, if word of such an alliance got out, it could damage the druidic order's reputation among humans and elves.
\par \tab Evil humanoids hold the druids in fairly high regard--some tribes always release druid captives. While these races couldn't care less for the sanctity of Nature or the welfare of animals, most humanoids respect Nature's mighty power and its servants.

\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Rangers and Elves
\par \tab 
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab The ranger class and the elven race resemble each other in that both consist of good aligned beings dwelling in the wil
d, protecting it from evil forces. Elves and rangers sometimes argue with druids over how best to guide the sylvan peoples and maintain the guardianship of the forests, but this is usually a friendly disagreement. If an area has a particularly effective r
a
nger presence, druids may agree to divide up responsibility for its guardianship: Rangers handle human and demihuman affairs, while druids take care of sylvan creatures and the problems of native animals and plants. Such informal arrangements, however, of
ten prove subject to swift change.
\par \tab Druids consider it a courtesy for a ranger of equivalent or lower level to ask permission to operate in an area they occupy and usually resent those who neglect this courtesy. If a ranger does ask permission, a druid gene
rally feels pleased to cooperate.
\par \tab Occasionally druids find elven or ranger actions one-sided, impetuous, or insufficiently ruthless to the job at hand. On the other hand, some elven council chambers and ranger gatherings ring with the accusation that drui
ds would give as much credence to the word of an orc or a green dragon as they do an elf or a treant. Those outside the Order fear the overly cunning druidic stratagems do not have the best interests of the elven nations at heart. But despite the occasion
al suspicion, many friendships grow up between druids and rangers or elves, and each group respects the other as protectors of the wild.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Gnomes and Halflings
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab Druids generally get along with the small folk and help them when the need arises. In turn, a majority of gnomes and halflings (even those that do not follow the druidic religion) respect druid characters.
\par \tab Most gnomes and halflings follow an ethos compatible with druidic beliefs: Live in harmony with the environment and rarely take from it more tha
n needed. Moreover, druids see them as practical people who, though inclined toward good, rarely develop the fanatical opposition to "evil" the druids have seen in some humans, elves, and dwarves.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Dwarves
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab The dwarven affinity with the earth primarily extends to unliving stone and metal, while the druids prize living trees and animals. As a result, druids and dwarves have very different philosophical outlooks.
\par \tab It doesn't help relations when dwarves cut down forests and dig ugly mine shafts in green moun
tainsides in their quest for the coal and firewood needed to feed their hungry forges. Nor do dwarves enjoy seeing druids favor elves and advocate a "live and let live" policy with the dwarves' arch-foes, the goblin races. The result? Druids and dwarves r
emain on poor terms and have harsh words for each other when they meet.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf13\cgrid0 Personality Types
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 
\par \tab You've now read how typical druids act in a variety of situations. But every druid--just like every other PC or significant NPC--should be different, with unique ha
bits and personality traits. Chapter 2: Druid Kits illustrated the "role" of each kit and how a druid with a certain kit usually behaves. But not every druid of the same branch and kit acts the same way. To expand on this idea, a half-dozen common persona
lity archetypes for druids follow.
\par \tab Please note that using these personality types is totally optional--feel free to make up your own! This section, while intended for use primarily by novice role-players, can prove quite useful for experienced players who 
feel temporarily stumped for role-playing ideas or for DMs wanting a quick personality for an NPC druid.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Diplomat
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab Th
e diplomat serves Nature best by resolving conflicts between intelligent beings through negotiation; wars must be avoided, as fields and forests burn regardless of which side wins. The fabled druidic neutrality makes these characters the clear choice for 
settling disputes, especially between human and nonhuman races.
\par \tab For instance, if a heated dispute between wood elves and sylvan centaurs threatened to flare into war, the character might step in as a peacemaker, discover the root of the conflict, and arran
ge a just compromise. Or, the druid could act as an ambassador for a kingdom of sylvan folk, representing them in a human court.
\par \tab In role-playing, the diplomat behaves with fairness and empathy. He always tries to see someone else's point of view, whether 
that someone else is an angry green dragon or a frivolous pixie, a proud knight or a hard-working farmer. But this fairness often masks an adamantine core of ruthless pragmatism. The character prefers solutions that benefit an entire region--including ani
m
als and plants--rather than a single faction. The diplomat isn't necessarily a pacifist--he may fight if talking fails or to enforce a peace he's brokered--but he prefers that a velvet glove mask the iron fist. Even so, the character generally takes the l
ong view and values the harmony of the whole over the good of the individual.
\par \tab This personality type works especially well with the Adviser, Pacifist, and Wanderer druid kits. It doesn't fit the Avenger or Guardian, but it can work with any other druid kits
. The diplomat is best suited to an all-druid campaign, since other classes prefer fighting to talking. However, a peacemaking role can lead to adventure and intrigue (providing roles for bards, thieves, illusionists, and other characters skilled in subtl
ety), especially if--as often happens--a third party or warlike faction secretly works to foment wars or quarrels. And trying to mediate a dispute between an angry green dragon and a human baron can prove both exciting and dangerous!
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Gardener
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab The garden
er views the world as a garden: It needs loving care and someone to cut down the weeds. The character remains very much aware of her responsibilities as a druid. A deep love for the land--with all its animals and people--drives her to take decisive action
 to nurture and protect it.
\par \tab A gardener believes a druid should actively intervene to promote the goals of the druidic order. She won't isolate herself in a grove in the wilderness. On the other hand, she usually stays in a particular region or country, fee
ling a close kinship to her own land, and knowing that she cannot take responsibility for the entire world.
\par \tab The gardener sees combat as a job that sometimes has to be done: Avoid the unnecessary battles, but win the necessary ones. She uses her head when 
she fights, trying whatever tricks and tactics might give her an edge. However, she does not believe the ends justify the means and will not resort to strategies that go against the druidic ethos or her own conscience.
\par \tab The character will see other people's points of view. Nevertheless, she lives devoted to the druidic ethos and actively carries the fight against anyone who threatens the land she holds dear.
\par \tab The gardener personality is common among druids. It suits the Adviser, Savage, Wanderer, and Village Druid kits, but avoid using it with the Guardian kit--a gardener doesn't limit her attention to just one area.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Idealist
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab An idealist character--usually a young initiate--feels convinced that Nature needs saving, and he's the one to do it. Always optimistic, he sometimes bites off more than he can chew. He prefers to seek simple solutions to complex problems.
\par \tab The idealist is
 usually pure of heart, meaning he doesn't lie or cheat and has few vices. While he seems fond of saying "Nature doesn't lie," he has yet to learn that many people do. Perhaps for that reason, people find it relatively easy to trick this character. Howeve
r, if he realizes he's been manipulated or if he discovers corruption in someone he considered honest, his temper will flare in a fierce fit of anger.
\par \tab In combat, the idealist rarely uses sophisticated tactics. He prefers to wield flashy spells, but will fight with physical weapons if necessary.
\par \tab A young idealist usually doesn't feel ready to settle down, so sedentary kits like the Guardian or Village Druid don't work for him. He does not possess the bitterness of an Avenger and lacks the discipline of a Nat
ural Philosopher and the subtlety of a good Adviser. The best kits for him are Beastfriend, Shapeshifter, or Wanderer.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Mysterious Figure
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab The mysterious figure is a druid with an enigmatic nature. She tends to appear and disappear regularly--show up, take swift action, vanish suddenly, and appear again when least expected and most needed.
\par \tab The mysterious figure normally has a personal mission to fulfill: a wrong to right, an archenemy to defeat, or a balance to redress. Often she has returned from exile,
 escaped death, or overcome some other personal tragedy, and uses her secretiveness to surprise and confound foes.
\par \tab The mysterious figure travels regularly, often going about in disguise or in animal shape. She makes many friends in unlikely places, but re
veals her real identity or purposes only to her closest companions. Her fondness for drama leads her to save her best spells for a grand entrance or for the crucial moment where she casts aside her disguise.
\par \tab 
Some druids with this personality have a quirky sense of humor. For instance, the druid may shapeshift into an animal before joining a party, becoming "adopted" as a pet before revealing her true form (if she does reveal it). This mischief works best for 
an NPC among PCs, or vice versa.
\par \tab But for all her showmanship, the mysterious figure remains a careful and cunning strategist. She always makes sure she has a few tricks up her sleeve that even her friends don't know about. If she has a flaw, it is an unwil
lingness to share with others the details of her plans.
\par \tab The mysterious figure works well as an Adviser, Outlaw, Shapeshifter, or Wanderer. Avoid pairing this personality with the Guardian or Village Druid kits.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Nurturer
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab The nurturer always seeks to he
lp those around him, whether the beneficiary is a plant, beast, or human; he feels especially drawn to the suffering of others. Unlike the gardener, the character concerns himself more with individuals than with communities or members of a particular alig
n
ment. The character may work as a professional healer, but also may take a more active role. For instance, he might go adventuring to seek and rescue captives and victims of oppression. Whatever his reason for joining a party, he cannot resist a genuine c
ry for help.
\par \tab The character does well providing emotional support to others, and people frequently turn to him with their troubles. He often proves a tower of strength in a crisis, rarely losing his courage. In combat, the character prefers to take a defens
ive role, protecting others and healing the injured. The character, while not a pacifist, remains reluctant to engage in violence, except to defend those under his care.
\par \tab The nurturer comes as close to a good alignment as any other druid personality archet
ype. However, he does provide care without regard to the victim's alignment. Also, unlike most good characters, this druid gives as high a priority to the suffering of beasts as to the plight of humans.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Rustic
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab This druid champions the common people. Sh
e prefers a roadside inn to a noble's castle and would rather visit a village fair than a knightly tournament. Depending on whether she likes to stay in one place or move around, she'll usually have either the Outlaw, Village Druid, Avenger, or Wanderer k
its. She has no interest in wealth--what she earns or finds she either gives to the needy or devotes to projects aimed at improving people's lives.
\par \tab The rustic won't take any actions she believes would endanger or exploit peasants; she always tries to sugge
st plans by which the party's actions might benefit the commoners. For instance, instead of rescuing a noble from a band of orcs, she'd prefer to take action against a robber baron who has been oppressing his tenants. Afterward, she'll try to make sure th
e peasants reclaim some of the treasure their greedy overlord took from them.
\par \tab If the character witnesses any kind of oppression of the common people, she becomes angry and wants to do something about it. If possible, she'll try to fix the situation--overth
row the evil baron, free the slaves, etc. If she doesn't believe she can win, she--ll usually try to make some gesture to help the victims, perhaps by giving agricultural advice, suggesting means of passive resistance, curing disease, donating money, or e
ven helping a single family escape to a better life. Then she'll vow to come back and do more when she gains the power to help. In short, the rustic believes in treating all fairly, regardless of social class.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Traditionalist
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab The traditionalist takes pri
de in the old ways and opposes change for the sake of change. This mindset applies to alterations in land use, shifts in the structure of the druidic order, and fluctuations in the pattern of daily life in the character's region.
\par \tab The traditionalist's phil
osophy means the druid vehemently opposes destroying the wilderness to replace it with crops, towns, or mines. Of course, he stands equally against radical druids like Shadow Circle members, who advocate the destruction of towns or cities. (However, some 
clever Shadow Circle members use a traditionalist facade.)
\par \tab Traditionalist druids usually think things were better in the past and talk incessantly about how the present doesn't match ancient glories. They take pride in the history and accomplishments of th
e druidic order and usually have the ancient history nonweapon proficiency. A traditionalist believes unshakably in the basic tenets of druidism, such as protecting the wilderness and maintaining the balance of Nature, as well as protecting druidic custom
s, such as the challenge. Often the character takes an active interest in druidic politics to make sure that suitably tradition-minded druids find their way to high-ranking positions.
\par \tab Almost any druid kit suits a traditionalist personality, provided the Or
der has an ancient history. On the other hand, say the DM decides that druids have developed the powers of the Shapeshifter kit only recently. In such a campaign, a traditionalist would avoid that kit.

\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab Th
e misanthrope doesn't like the company of people. Usually she considers mankind bad for Nature. A misanthrope may have had a particularly bad experience that soured her on mankind. Depending on her kit, she may prefer the company of animals or the solitud
e of the wilds.
\par \tab In role-playing, the misanthrope generally assumes the worst of people. She may not act hostile, but it takes a lot of effort from the party to encourage friendliness. By her very nature, she tends toward dour, pessimistic behavior. She tru
sts no humans, and few demihumans or humanoids.
\par \tab The misanthrope's unselfish love of Nature partially redeems her hostility; characters who display a similar affection for animals or the wild find her a true friend. Even so, deeds, not words, are the only things that can win her friendship.
\par \tab The misanthrope has trouble verbalizing feelings--even if she likes or approves of someone, she won't say so. She'll simply offer her assistance. If she dislikes someone, or if something makes her angry, she's likely to
 turn her back and leave without a word.
\par \tab In combat, she doesn't bluff and rarely utters a threat more than once. If she must use violence to protect herself or something she cares for, she'll strike without warning.
\par \tab A misanthrope doesn't fit in with a party of human adventurers, but she makes a good NPC, especially if the party has a particular reason to seek her friendship.
\par \tab This personality type works well with Beastfriends, Guardians, Shapeshifters, and Totemic Druids. It can fit Avengers, Natural Philosophers, and Wanderers, but does not suit Advisers, Savages, or Village Druids.

\par }{\b\fs28\cf13\cgrid0 Druid Campaigns
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 
\par \tab So far this chapter has dealt with ways to role-play druid characters in normal AD&D campaigns. But it's quite possible to use this information to run an adventure focusing on druids alone. A DM could handle such a campaign one of several ways.

\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 All or Mostly Druids?
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab The DM of a druid-centered campaign can choose to restrict players to druid characters only. This setup works best with fewer than four playe
rs. On the other hand, druid-centered campaigns involving many players can benefit from the presence of one or two appropriate nondruid characters. The DM may allow bards, rangers, and those clerics, mages, or fighters with Peasant or Outlaw kits. (See }{
\i\fs24\cgrid0 The Complete Priest's Handbook, The Complete Wizard's Handbook}{\fs24\cgrid0 , and}{\i\fs24\cgrid0  The Complete Fighter's Handbook}{\fs24\cgrid0 .)
\par \tab After DMs choose to run an all-druid campaign, they must next decide whether to have a party of druids from a variety of branches or from only one.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Single-Branch Campaigns.}{\fs24\cgrid0 
 Some campaigns center around druids in a single circle and the doings of those native to the area. Most PCs will represent the same branch: that of the area's dominant terrain. For example, campaigns set in mountainous terrain feature mos
tly mountain druids; if the campaign were set in the Underdark, most of the characters would be gray druids.
\par \tab This campaign gives the PCs a strong sense of identity and creates a united party, since all its members have similar goals. It also allows the DM
 to focus on interdruid politics (such as the rise of the Shadow Circle or the rivalry between various druidic branches). A single-branch campaign involving an unusual branch (like the arctic druids) gives the DM an opportunity to run a change-of-pace adv
enture set in a different environment. PCs can venture to remote locations, meet members of little-known cultures, and encounter monsters they otherwise would rarely happen upon.
\par \tab On the down side, although players can distinguish the characters from each o
ther by giving them each different kits, players still may wish for more variety within the party. Try making some of the characters druids from associated branches; for instance, if the adventure takes place near a forest on a mountainside, some of the c
haracters resemble a mix of both the forest and mountain druid branches.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Multibranch Campaigns.}{\fs24\cgrid0 
 In a campaign involving only druids, the DM may encourage players to choose characters from different branches. The advantage of this arrangement? It provides a strong variety of characters--especially since they also may have different druid kits. Howev
er, a disadvantage is the difficulty of explaining why a jungle druid and an arctic druid want to adventure together in the first place.
\par \tab One way to get around this problem requires bringing the PCs together for a reason. Perhaps the characters each represe
nt their particular region in a quest the Grand Druid has launched to help fight a world-shaking problem. This scenario gives them the single-branch campaign's sense of shared mission, but more variety.
\par \tab And, there could be any number of reasons why this special group of beginning characters was selected. Pick one of the following justifications:
\par {\pntext\pard\plain\f3 \loch\af3\dbch\af0\hich\f3 \'b7\tab}}\pard \fi-360\li810\nowidctlpar\tx0\tx450{\*\pn \pnlvlblt\ilvl0\ls1\pnrnot0\pnf3\pnindent360 {\pntxtb \'b7}}\ls1\adjustright {\fs24\cgrid0 
The Grand Druid chose them because they fit an ancient prophecy.
\par {\pntext\pard\plain\f3 \loch\af3\dbch\af0\hich\f3 \'b7\tab}}\pard \fi-360\li810\nowidctlpar\tx0\tx450{\*\pn \pnlvlblt\ilvl0\ls1\pnrnot0\pnf3\pnindent360 {\pntxtb \'b7}}\ls1\adjustright {\fs24\cgrid0 
The upper ranks of the druids are too conservative (or filled with untrustworthy agents of the Shadow Circle), and only these members of the younger generation see the true threat facing the world.
\par {\pntext\pard\plain\f3 \loch\af3\dbch\af0\hich\f3 \'b7\tab}}\pard \fi-360\li810\nowidctlpar\tx0\tx450{\*\pn \pnlvlblt\ilvl0\ls1\pnrnot0\pnf3\pnindent360 {\pntxtb \'b7}}\ls1\adjustright {\fs24\cgrid0 
There are few druids left--a growing evil wiped out most of the Order's upper ranks. (A very nasty situation indeed!)
\par }\pard \nowidctlpar\tx0\tx450{\*\pn \pnlvlcont\ilvl0\ls0\pnrnot0\pndec }\adjustright {\fs24\cgrid0 \tab A more serious problem in ga
me balance for multibranch campaigns lies in the fact that each branch works best in a single terrain type: the desert druid operates best in the desert; the gray druid has optimal powers only in the underworld, and so on. As a result, a multibranch druid
 
campaign needs to involve a fair bit of traveling; if the characters stay in the forest or the dungeon all the time, the player of an arctic or swamp druid will feel useless! Forcing the characters to travel widely, fighting an evil that recurs in several
 guises, can make for an exciting adventure involving all the characters.
\par \tab For example, in a campaign with the goal of defeating the followers of a chaotic evil god corrupting Nature, the first adventure might take the party to a swamp that had been defiled
 into a place of horror. The druids would deal with toxic water, mutant giant insects, will o' wisps, black dragons, and other swamp monsters. A clue then can lead them to an adventure in the frozen arctic, where the PCs hear of a blizzard without end and
 the creatures that lurk within it. With this kind of approach, every branch of druid has a chance to shine.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Guardians of the Wild
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab In this campaign, the druids must defend a tract of wilderness from those who wish to exploit it. To make this story stron
ger, develop druid characters with a personal stake in the area. For example, the region could hold an ancient grove in which a PC was initiated into the druidic order. Or maybe it serves as home to a tribe of sylvan beings who have befriended a character
.
\par \tab 
An interesting problem develops if the druids discover that the individuals cutting down their wood or draining their swamp have a very good reason to do so. As a result, the druids--and players--find themselves faced with a more complex moral dilemma th
an simply, "Run those exploiters off the land." They must look behind the problem to get at its heart.
\par \tab This campaign suits players who enjoy diplomacy and politics, and generally works best with relatively high-level druids. This scenario lets the charact
ers explore a key element of the druid's ethos: the need to see everyone's point of view, then judge which path best serves druidic interests.
\par \tab For instance, suppose the druids learn of a problem in the area when hundreds of migrant laborers--mostly poor f
olk with no farms of their own--descend like locusts on the characters' ancient forest, chopping down trees and bearing them away. Worse, several species of rare animals live near here, and the logging threatens to destroy their home.
\par \tab Where did these labo
rers come from? The party learns they work for a nation of dwarves living nearby. These mountain dwarves, having exhausted their supply of coal, had to turn to wood to keep the forges burning. They pay the poor human laborers in gold for every log they br
ing in. Already the dwarves' own mountain stands denuded of trees. The druids' verdant preserve seems the only nearby source of firewood.
\par \tab The migrant laborers have more immediate concerns than the dangers of exfoliation. A lean harvest this year has meant 
little work, and without the dwarves' bounty, the humans risk starvation. As long as the dwarves pay, they will be able to buy food for the winter. . . 
\par \tab But what made the dwarves decide to expand their activities so much that they exhausted their coal resources?
\par \tab War. The mountain dwarves are forging weapons for a small elven kingdom two day's journey away, struggling against an alliance of migrating bugbear and ogre tribes. Except for the royal guard, these elves--caught by surprise--lacked proper armor a
nd weapons to withstand the onslaught. The dwarves didn't want to get involved, but agreed to forge the elves fine long swords, armor, and arrowheads in exchange for a share of the valuable emerald deposits located within the elven kingdom.
\par \tab The DM could s
top here and decide to call the bugbears and ogres the villains. But perhaps things are not quite that simple. What started the bugbear-ogre migration? Perhaps a powerful dragon drove them from their land; now they have become refugees themselves, wishing
 to settle in empty areas within the elven wood. However, the elves refused (not desiring such rude neighbors).
\par \tab A campaign of this sort gives druids many options. The characters could merely drive the woodcutters from the forest--but terrorizing them may s
pur the dwarves to hire adventurers to deal with the druids! The party could play it sneaky--help the elves win a quick victory by destroying the ogre-bugbear alliance. (The druids slay the bugbear chieftain, but make it look like a rival ogre chief did i
t
.) Or, the solution could prove complex, if the druids decide to try negotiating a peace treaty between the elves and the bugbear-ogre alliance. If the DM works out the personalities and goals of the major figures, each of the druids' actions could carry 
its own set of consequences.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 The Evil Woods
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab In the center of a once beautiful sylvan forest lies a place of power--a grove at one time sacred to the druids. Unfortunately, its defenders were not as strong as they thought and, in a weak moment, allowed a
 dreadful evil to creep into the land. These forces captured and defiled the sacred grove; now darkness has fallen over the ancient woods.
\par \tab Nature itself has felt the corrupting power of this evil. Flocks of vampire bats, clusters of stirges, and clouds of
 stinging insects darken the skies. Bugbears and goblins roam the outskirts of the wood, but even they do not venture into the interior, which rumor calls home to horrors beyond imagining: flesh-eating treants, cannibal elves, undead animals, and dark uni
corns with poisoned horns. All these creatures manifest the terrible cancer emanating from the once sacred grove, which now bears a terrible curse--a curse that is spreading . . . 
\par \tab 
This campaign will prove a challenge for any druidic party. The evil forces include a mix of standard woodland monsters like bugbears and green dragons, and twisted, evil versions of normally good or neutral sylvan beings like dryads and elves. The druids
-
-possibly allied with good-aligned adventurers--do not know exactly what evil corrupted the sacred grove, so they have to move carefully at first, scouting the forest. The cursed woods resembles a dungeon: The farther the characters penetrate, the more de
adly it becomes, with the power that destroyed the original Guardians waiting, spiderlike, in the center of the sacred grove.

sed to Shadow Circle policies, the PCs may try to find out what is going on so they can sound the alarm or nip the plan in the bud--but getting anyone to believe word of an impending invasion may prove difficult without concrete evidence, for few know the
 truth about the Shadow Circle.

 permanently links the soul of the caster with a tree, usually chosen carefully for its health, vigor, and remote environment. Casting this spell joins the life force of the druid with that of the tree; as long as the tree 
lives, the caster ages at one-tenth the normal rate. (Because the spell causes the tree to devote all its energy to maintaining health rather than growth, it always remains exactly the size it was at the time of casting.) Moreover, the caster's spirit mer
ges with the tree at the character's death. No form of reincarnation or resurrection (except a }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 wish}{\fs24\cgrid0 ) on the character's body will work unless it lies within 10 feet of the tree.
\par \tab One year after the caster dies, the druid's spirit animates the tree as a trea
nt. (DMs should roll up treant statistics for the tree at the time the spell is cast, to determine the tree's Armor Class, Hit Dice, etc.) The chosen tree must be of treant height; the exact size determines the size of the new treant, which possesses the 
caster's memories and personality but has no granted powers or spellcasting ability. It must communicate as a treant. 
\par \tab The DM decides whether to consider this treant an NPC or allow the player to control it. (DMs should use the guidelines that apply to PCs who become lycanthropes or undead.)
\par \tab However, when a druid uses }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 tree spirit}{\fs24\cgrid0  to link with a tree, the character suffers any physical damage inflicted on the tree. For instance, if someone hacks at the tree with an axe and causes 4 points of damage, the cas
ter also loses 4 hit points; the druid knows the tree has been harmed, but does not know the nature of the injury. 
\par \tab If the tree dies but does not sustain enough damage to kill the caster, the character feels stunned for 1d6 rounds and must make a successful system shock roll to avoid death. Spells that heal the druid do not affect the tree.
\par \tab Damage to the caster does not affect the tree, as the extra energy the tree expends on strength and health makes any damage the player sustains negligible to the tree.
 However, it's usually in the druid's best interest to have an animal friend or two guard the tree. 
\par \tab In addition, the druid should choose the tree carefully; if the surrounding land is cleared for construction work or lumber before the druid's prolonged life span finally ends, the character is in trouble.
\par \tab Casting }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 tree spirit}{\fs24\cgrid0  first requires a full month's preparation. The druid lives near the tree during this time of prayer and mediation. Then the character conducts a private bonding ceremony at the height
 of a solstice. This spell often is cast by ancient druids, who wish to preserve their wisdom or make sure their groves remain defended even after their death.

\par Duration: Permanent
\par Casting Time: 1 round
\par Area of Effect: 10-yard radius
\par Saving Throw: Special
\par 
\par \tab A caster can transform one or more living creatures within a 10-yard radius into }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 unwilling wood}{\fs24\cgrid0 , causing them to sprout roots, branches, and leaves. The 
victims become trees of a type native to the region and of the characters' age before the transformation. The spell works only if cast on beings occupying ground that could support a tree; recipients flying or suspended in water at the time of casting rem
ain unaffected.
\par \tab This spell can mutate a number of creatures equal in total Hit Dice (or levels) to the caster's level within the area of effect, of course. If this a
rea holds a group of creatures with Hit Dice (or levels) totaling a number greater than the caster's experience level, the character may decide the order in which the creatures become affected.
\par \tab For instance, say a 14th-level druid casts}{\i\fs24\cgrid0  unwilling wood}{\fs24\cgrid0  int
o a target area containing a giant with 12 Hit Dice and two 3rd-level warriors. The druid can transform either the giant or two warriors, but not all three. "Leftover" Hit Dice or levels are lost.
\par \tab Each creature affected may attempt to save vs. polymorph. 
The spell mutates all those failing their saving throw, along with any items they carry. A new tree has a height of 5 feet per level (or Hit Die) of the victim. The effect is permanent; a person transformed into a tree ages as a tree and dies as a tree. H
owever, affected characters retain awareness, memories, personality, and intelligence. Only damage severe enough to kill the tree can kill an }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 unwilling wood}{\fs24\cgrid0  victim.
\par \tab Tree-characters can return to normal if a spellcaster of greater level than the original caster uses }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 remove curse}{\fs24\cgrid0 . The original caster can release a transformed entity at will.

\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 
\par \tab Druid characters can use the magical items generally permitted priests 
except written ones, such as scrolls or books. They can wear magical armor only when it is natural, such as wooden shields. Any magical weapon a druid uses must be of a type permitted to priests, as well as by the character's druidic kit and branch.

\par \tab This section contains new magical items that fit the druid's role of Nature priest, keeper of the balance, and dweller in the country. In addition, a small number of the items are designed for use against druids.
\par \tab Although this listing contains some powerful items, many are fairly low-key. Items like the }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 bountiful spade}{\fs24\cgrid0 , or}{\i\fs24\cgrid0  seeds of plenty}{\fs24\cgrid0 
 represent the kind of magical item a high-level character would create as a gift for a favored farmer or lord. Druids might offer cursed items like the }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 necklace of beast speech}{\fs24\cgrid0 
 to someone as punishment for wronging the Order or the land.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Creating Magical Items
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab The normal rules for priests creating magical items (}{\i\fs24\cgrid0 DMG}{\fs24\cgrid0  pgs. 83-88) apply to druids as well. In almost all cases, gathering the rare, unique, or impossible component
s and combining them properly remains more important than purchasing expensive materials; quest and ritual take precedence over the depth of the druid's purse.
\par \tab The personal touch is vital: Druids must make the vessels for enchantment using their nonweapon
 proficiencies. Characters needn't be expert artisans, but they cannot create a magical scimitar merely by enchanting a weapon someone else has made. As a result, a druid who completes an arduous series of tasks to collect the necessary components may not
 actually have to spend any money to build the item, although major magical items require components easily worth the 1,000 to 10,000 gp noted in the }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 DMG}{\fs24\cgrid0  (p. 87).
\par \tab Priest characters must spend up to three weeks meditating, fasting, and purifying themselves 
before they can enchant an item. Druids must begin this process at a sacred time, like an equinox, for the enchantment to have any chance of success. Druids purify the vessel and pray for its consecration not at an altar, but at their grove.

\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Making an Herbal Brew
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab To create an herbal brew, the druid must have the appropriate ingredients, either fresh or preserved. The brewing p
rocess requires a quiet place that fosters deep concentration. It involves both physical work (chopping and cleaning herbs, mixing the ingredients in proper portions, steaming them, etc.) and ritual gestures and prayer. As with granted powers and spells, 
if the druid has not remained faithful to the Order, the herbs fail to take on their magical properties.
\par \tab After preparing the concoction as long as the brew's description requires, the druid rolls another herbalism proficiency check, using the modifiers sho
wn. In addition, a -2 modifier applies if the druid used preserved rather than fresh herbs. A successful check means the druid creates the brew. Failure means the druid ruins the ingredients; a roll of 19 or 20 always fails.
\par \tab A druid with several sets of ingredients for the same herbal brew may mix multiple batches at the same time. If the final proficiency check succeeds, the druid concocts all the batches; if it fails, the ingredients all go to waste.

\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Search Time/Modifier}{\fs24\cgrid0  indicates how many hours a druid must search for the brew\rquote s ingredients and offers a modifier to the herbalism proficiency check that determines whether the druid finds them.

\par \tab A }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 poultice}{\fs24\cgrid0 
 consists of a damp herbal brew bandaged onto a wound or area of skin. The contents of the poultice soaks into the skin gradually. Applying a poultice takes two rounds; it can be applied only to an unresisting or grappled subject.
\par \tab A }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 vapor}{\fs24\cgrid0

\par Chapter 6: Sacred Groves\tab 
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 
\par \tab When not adventuring, druids prefer to live near a }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 sacred grove}{\fs24\cgrid0  and worship there as we
ll. While the term "sacred grove" usually calls to mind a stand of trees within a forest, here it refers to any sacred place where druids worship Nature. All sacred groves are places of great natural beauty--and sometimes magical power. Areas with a histo
ry of druidic veneration tend to acquire wondrous abilities from their prolonged contact with druidic magic and rites.
\par \tab Sometimes several druids share a single sacred grove. This arrangement enables them to take turns adventuring or traveling, leaving someo
ne always on hand to protect and tend the grove. Druids occupying a sacred grove singly have to arrange for its safety before departing: setting various wards and traps, or arranging for allies to protect it in the druid's absence.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf13\cgrid0 Features of a Sacred Grove
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 
\par \tab Each branch of the druidic order prefers certain sites for sacred groves. These include the woodland groves of the forest druids, the oases of the desert druid, the fungus-rich caves of the gray druid, and so on. In nearly every case, the overriding 
requirement is that the sacred grove possess a natural splendor. This splendor may range from the stark grandeur of a ring of standing stones atop a hill on a windswept moor to the gardenlike beauty of a tended forest glade.
\par \tab A sacred grove is typically between 60 feet and 360 feet across (6d6 - 10 feet). Besides the expected grass, undergrowth, bushes, trees, or other local features, desirable groves share certain elements.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Distinct Boundaries
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab Sacred groves reveal themselves readily to those who know w
hat to look for. A grove's boundary markers often result from the efforts of generations of druids. For example, the trees in a woodland grove may form concentric circles, the outermost layer reserved for the largest, most ancient trees.
\par \tab Often the trees i
n a sacred grove are of an unusual size or a type distinct from others in the wood. For example, a sacred grove in a birch forest might have many oaks. Their branches may even entwine to form natural arches to welcome visitors. In more open terrains, sacr
ed groves may surround themselves with high, thorny hedges or even a river. Some groves have artificial borders, such as an outer ring of standing stones. A few are small islands.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 A Clearing
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab A quiet place of meditation blanketed with soft moss or grass lies in the center of the grove. Druids prefer groves carpeted with soft ground cover that encourages dancing over a floor of simple dirt or stone.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Source of Water
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab A spring, well, brook, or pool (often fed by a waterfall) provides the grove with pure, 
drinkable water. Druids use this water in their rituals and in their day-to-day life as well. Some druids prefer still water to a brook or spring, since the quiet water is less distracting during meditation and can prove useful in divination.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Central Feature
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab A commanding structure--perhaps the source of water--acts as a natural altar in the grove or as a focus for worship. Other common central features include a single great tree, a standing stone, or a fairy ring (a circle of toadstools or 
other fungi). These and other features sometimes possess magical powers, detailed in a later section.
\par Native Animals
\par \tab An owl lives in a grove's great tree, a snake dwells under a stone--the druid is never really alone in a sacred grove. The place feels alive in every sense, and druids usually befriend a grove's inhabitants.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Living Quarters
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab While the druid and any servants or family members rarely live within the sacred grove proper, home lies not far away. A forest druid, for instance, generally has a s
tone, log, or sod cottage within a mile of the grove, with a vegetable and herb garden, and perhaps a few domestic animals.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Stewardship
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 
\par \tab Although druids do not claim to "own" sacred groves, they take responsibility for them very seriously. The druid asso
ciated with a grove normally goes by the title of steward, keeper, or caretaker. Stewardship of a sacred grove is traditional: Keepers always designate their successors.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Guards and Wards
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab The steward of a sacred grove is first and foremost responsible f
or the grove's safety, especially if the grove has "awakened" with magical powers (explained later in this chapter) or if beings such as dryads live there. Therefore, druids devote considerable effort to protecting a sacred grove--in some cases, through s
ecrecy. Only a few trustworthy people and creatures know the grove's location. A druid obscures the pathway to the grove, while }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 hallucinatory forest}{\fs24\cgrid0 
 spells and better-cleared false trails twist away from it, leading a searcher astray.
\par \tab More active defenses include pits covered with branches and leaves (perhaps sharp stakes, poisonous spiders, or snakes). Druids of at least 5th level use the }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 snare }{\fs24\cgrid0 
spell liberally, as its defenses remain fixed until triggered. Using }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 plant growth}{\fs24\cgrid0  to set up permanent dense barri
ers around the grove is a very good strategy, especially if a druid plans to lace the obvious paths through these barriers with traps and snares, leaving only one or two concealed "safe" passages.
\par \tab If enemies are on their way, the druid should strive to pr
event them from using fire to damage the grove. Controlling weather to create a rainstorm before foes even reach the grove keeps the enemy miserable and stops the grass, bushes, and wood from igniting. Of course, one of the best ways a druid can defend a 
grove is to discover potential enemies and strike before they even reach the sacred natural site. (See "Eyes in the Wilderness," Chapter 4.)
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Tending the Grove
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab While safeguarding the grove remains most important, stewards must not neglect regular care. T
his day-to-day work involves tending the plants and animals in the grove, talking to them, and dealing with illnesses or parasites that might appear. In addition, if a druid prefers a gardenlike appearance to a wild one, the steward cleans up loose branch
e
s, prunes trees and bushes, and so on. Druids should devote 12 days per month to this job, or about three days per week. If a druid fails in this duty, the DM can assume the sacred grove's health and appearance deteriorates (as does the magic of awakened 
groves, lesser powers first). Deterioration is immediately obvious to any visiting druid.
\par \tab Several druids may use the same sacred grove as a place of worship, sharing the work detailed above, but only one is its steward; the others usually consider themselv
es the sacred grove's tenders. By tradition, if the keeper dies or retires, one of the tenders takes over the stewardship.
\par \tab It is considered a crime for one druid in the Order to forcibly displace another from a stewardship. Such an incident, when reported
 to the great druid, constitutes grounds for the ban. In response, several druids will join together to expel the offender from the grove, finding a more suitable replacement--the original steward, if that druid did not die in the grove's defense.
\par \tab An exce
ption is allowed when a druid's negligence results in the deterioration or defilement of a sacred grove. In this case, an inner circle druid or the great druid appoints a new keeper for the grove. It becomes that druid's responsibility to reclaim the grov
e, by force if necessary, from its inept steward.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Grove Law}{\fs24\cgrid0 
\par \tab 
\par \tab Druids, far stricter about protecting their sacred groves than any other wilderness area, have established a law to safeguard these special sites. The following points make
 up the law of the grove, upheld by all except the steward and those with special dispensation from the steward:
\par {\pntext\pard\plain\f3 \loch\af3\dbch\af0\hich\f3 \'b7\tab}}\pard \fi-360\li810\nowidctlpar\tx0\tx450{\*\pn \pnlvlblt\ilvl0\ls1\pnrnot0\pnf3\pnindent360 {\pntxtb \'b7}}\ls1\adjustright {\fs24\cgrid0 
No trees or plants within the grove may be harmed, cut, or pruned. No one may pick or cut branches, berries, nuts, or fruit, either; visitors can eat or otherwise use only that which has fallen to the ground.

\par }\pard \nowidctlpar\tx0\tx450{\*\pn \pnlvlcont\ilvl0\ls0\pnrnot0\pndec }\adjustright {\fs24\cgrid0 \tab The maximum penalty for violating the law o
f the grove is death, though a druid may apply a lesser penalty in certain cases. The punishment for violating these rules--or for more serious defilement of a sacred grove--depends on the offender's motives, the damage, and the druid's inclination. If a 
cruel wizard damaged a sacred grove with a }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 fireball}{\fs24\cgrid0 
 in an attack on the steward, the druid would think death a proper punishment-- preferably death by fire. On the other hand, if a careless toddler did the same damage by accidentally setting fire to the gro
ve, the druid seeks a more suitable punishment: kidnaping the child to raise as a druid. Thus the child devotes a lifetime to atonement.
\par \tab Note that there is no law against folk entering the grove. While some druids keep visitors away, others welcome people
 and animals who come to admire the grove or worship, and even shelter needy travelers. Similarly, the steward may allow visitors to collect fallen deadwood, fruits, nuts, and berries. Since druids usually can speak with the animals, plants, and (sometime
s) stones in their grove, they can determine easily how a person acquired suspicious bounty.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Becoming a Steward
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab A druid player character can acquire stewardship of a sacred grove in four ways:
\par \tab First, the keeper of a grove might nominate the PC to becom
e the successor to the stewardship. This tactic allows the PC to take over when the existing steward dies, disappears, or decides not to care for the grove any longer. The successor must have the current steward's trust and respect, and usually has spent 
t
ime worshiping in the grove and tending it under supervision. Most of all, the nominee must prove worthy to defend the grove. If the grove has magic, the character should have reached at least 7th level to deserve consideration. However, young sacred grov
es lacking magic often receive the protection of lower-level druids.
\par \tab Second, a player character can find an abandoned sacred grove and reclaim it. Sometimes a powerful monster or other foe eliminates both the steward of a sacred grove }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 and }{\fs24\cgrid0 the chosen succes
sor. Such groves often are cursed, haunted by undead, or frequented by local monsters. But a druid who overcomes these obstacles and reclaims the grove proves worthy of the stewardship.
\par \tab Third, a stewardship may come with a title, although this practice va
ries from circle to circle. For instance, a circle may award the responsibility for certain sacred groves to its archdruids or great druid, and--unlike a normal grove--this stewardship changes hands as new druids assume the high ranks. At the DM's discret
ion, the world might even hold a wondrous "high sacred grove"-- the responsibility of the Grand Druid.
\par \tab Fourth, a PC can find a virgin grove site and sanctify it. Virgin groves match the physical requirements listed earlier for a sacred grove, but have no m
agical powers and have never been tended. Finding such a spot is simply a matter of the druid's knowledge of local geography. A virgin grove rarely has clear boundaries, so the druid may make "improvements," such as planting a circle of trees or erecting 
standing stones to mark the new grove's borders.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf13\cgrid0 Sanctifying and Awakening a Grove
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 
\par \tab Druids may wish to consecrate a sacred grove, perhaps awaken it to its magical properties. To this end, they must find a suitable natural site with the features described earlier.
\par \tab After preparing a site, the druid performs a ritual to sanctify it. This ceremony, a blessing and invocation of Nature--takes a day of uninterrupted prayer. Once sanctified, a site becomes a sacred grove--a living shrine to Nature, where druids c
an perform their rites.
\par \tab As druids worship there over the years, a sacred grove tends to absorb power from the rituals, becoming a holier place. If druids consistently venerate a grove, it may awaken to the magical powers described earlier. Venerating a gr
ove means that druids (not necessarily just the one who sanctified it) pray and meditate there on a regular basis. Furthermore, the druid appointed the grove's steward must faithfully tend it.
\par \tab A sanctified sacred grove actively visited and tended for seve
n years has a chance to gain magical powers. This time need not be contiguous--that is, a sacred grove can be active for five years, then abandoned, then active for another two years. After the seven years have passed, the DM begins rolling 1d10 each spri
ng. On a roll of 10, the grove "awakens." Awakened groves gain the basic powers of a lesser sacred grove and a special ability (Table 3).

\fs24\cgrid0  spell. They will act to protect themselves and defend the grove.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Bountiful.}{\fs24\cgrid0  If t
he sacred grove contains plants that produce edible fruit, nuts, or berries, 3d6+20 enchanted examples sprout each spring along with the usual crop. The magic fruit, nuts, or berries--the largest and most healthy of their species--confer the benefits of a
 }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 goodberry}{\fs24\cgrid0  spell's products on the characters who eat them. Once picked, no more will grow until the following year.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Control Temperature.}{\fs24\cgrid0  Any Nature worshiper in the grove may make a grove's temperature rise or fall within 30 degrees. This ability, possibl
e once per day, affects the entire grove. Arctic or desert groves commonly feature this power, which enables those in the grove to survive brief climatic extremes, especially combined with the power to still winds (below).
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Faerie Fire.}{\fs24\cgrid0  A Nature worshiper (even a nonpriest) may cause a }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 faerie fire}{\fs24\cgrid0 
 luminance to appear, centered on the character or upon any of the trees, rocks, or standing stones in the grove. The }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 faerie fire}{\fs24\cgrid0 , which lasts one turn per level of the caller, can be summoned once per person in a 
given day. }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 Faerie fire}{\fs24\cgrid0  that druids call endures for two turns per level of the druid and can flicker about the grove at will. When a druid casts a}{\i\fs24\cgrid0  faerie fire}{\fs24\cgrid0 
 spell within the grove, its duration triples.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Healing.}{\fs24\cgrid0  Beings of neutral alignment or those alli
ed to the druid may heal wounds at twice the rate of natural healing while in the magical sacred grove. Healing-related spells produce the maximum benefits; for instance, }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 cure light wounds}{\fs24\cgrid0  restores 8 points of damage.

\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Prophecy.}{\fs24\cgrid0  A druid who spends the nigh

\i\fs24\cgrid0 commune with nature}{\fs24\cgrid0  spell. The portent usually warns of danger or hints at a task Nature wishes the druid to perform.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Protective Aura.}{\fs24\cgrid0  Any creature but a druid, dryad, or nymph who sees the grove must save vs. spell. Those who fail perceive the grove as nothi
ng other than a normal clearing (or the like) until they are led into it. The sacred grove also generates a continual protective field similar to }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 protection from evil, 10' radius,}{\fs24\cgrid0 
 except it covers the entire grove and has the powers of both }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 protection from evil}{\fs24\cgrid0  and }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 protection from good}{\fs24\cgrid0  spells.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Still Winds.}{\fs24\cgrid0  Worshipers of Nature in the sacred grove (even nonpriests) can cause winds to calm for up to one turn per level, as long as they concentrate on maintaining this power. Triple the duration when a druid in
vokes it. This power, possible once per day, is quite common in desert, mountain, and arctic groves, as it protects the sacred grove and those in it from sandstorms, tornadoes, or snowstorms, and the like.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Sweet Water.}{\fs24\cgrid0  Water from a source within the grove or dew gathered from the grass in the area has the properties of }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 sweet water}{\fs24\cgrid0 
, but loses these special properties as soon as it is removed from the site.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Special.}{\fs24\cgrid0  The DM can create a power associated with the branch or kit of the druid that sanctified thi
s grove. For instance, the grove of a Hivemaster might contain a wasp's nest or beehive from which a druid could call an }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 insect plague}{\fs24\cgrid0 
 once per day, while a swamp druid's grove could feature a patch of firm ground that turns suddenly to quicksandlike mud (as in a }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 rock to mud}{\fs24\cgrid0  spell).

 A large, ancient tree living in the grove gains Intelligence and Wisdom (2d6+6), the spellcasting ability of a 3rd-level druid, and the power of speech. It can use any two of its branches at once like arms. It speaks--in a deep, slow voice--in the secret
 language of the druids. In combat, treat it as a treant created by the }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 liveoak}{\fs24\cgrid0  spell. Roots bind it to the earth like a normal tree.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Beast Speech.}{\fs24\cgrid0  Any normal or giant animal with an Intelligence score between animal and low can speak and understand the se
cret language of the druids for as long as it remains within the sacred grove. The animal's Intelligence does not increase. Also, casting }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 animal summoning}{\fs24\cgrid0  calls a 50% greater number (or Hit Dice) of animals than usual.

\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Concealment.}{\fs24\cgrid0  All mobile beings (not normal plants) within the grove when this power is invoked become }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 invisible}{\fs24\cgrid0 
 for three turns per level of the druid or until they leave the grove. This power, possible once a day, ceases to conceal anyone who attacks.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Earthpower.}{\fs24\cgrid0  When druids in the sacred grove cast a Plant or Earth Elemental sphere spell within its boundaries, they double the spell's duration, area of effect, and range.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Know Alignment.}{\fs24\cgrid0  A druid may know the alignment of others in the sacred grove by concentrating one round. (The druid and 
subject must remain in the grove during this time.) This spell-like power can be used any number of times. Nonpriest worshipers of Nature can use this power after two rounds of concentration (and two successful Wisdom checks), but can make only one attemp
t.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Peaceful.}{\fs24\cgrid0 
 Anyone entering this grove may notice odd sights, like predators and prey playing together. Those who make a successful attack against another within this grove must make a saving throw vs. wands. Attackers who fail suffer all the damage thems
elves; the wounds they meant to inflict appear on their own bodies. If they save, they suffer only half damage.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Reincarnation.}{\fs24\cgrid0  If a druid's ashes or remains are buried in the sacred grove, the character becomes }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 reincarnated}{\fs24\cgrid0  (per the priest spell). The new
 incarnation appears within a mile of the grove in 1d6 days.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Waters of Life.}{\fs24\cgrid0  Any source of water within the grove has unusual healing properties. Anyone bathing in the water (maximum of once per day per person) gains the benefit of simultaneous }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 neutralize
 poison, cure disease}{\fs24\cgrid0 , and }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 cure serious wounds}{\fs24\cgrid0  spells. The water loses all special properties outside the grove's boundaries, however, so characters cannot use it as a }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 healing}{\fs24\cgrid0 
 potion.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Scrying Pool.}{\fs24\cgrid0  A source of still water within the grove, such as a pool or well, may be used for divination. Once per day a druid can command the pool or well to act as a }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 reflecting pool}{\fs24\cgrid0 
 cast at the druid's level.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Magic Fruit.}{\fs24\cgrid0  The grove has a tree whose fruit or berries have a magical effect when eaten. In a given year, 1d6 f

\par 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Entrancing. }{\fs24\cgrid0 This curse can apply to any grove containing a source of water or plants bearing fruit, nuts, or berries. Those who eat n
atural fruits of the grove or drink its water must save vs. spell or become charmed: They refuse to leave the grove, claiming they must defend this beautiful place. They resist forcefully if anyone tries to harm the grove or take them from it. The charm i
s broken if those it has entranced leave the grove, or it can wear off, per the }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 charm person}{\fs24\cgrid0  spell.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Poisoned Ground. }{\fs24\cgrid0 A terrible poison lives within the ground, although the plants in the grove are immune. Those who touch the vegetation (including grass) wi
th bare skin must save vs. poison each round of contact or suffer 1d6 points of damage. Characters who eat fruits, etc., from the grove must save vs. poison or die.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Haunted.}{\fs24\cgrid0  The life forces of people who die in a haunted grove or within a mile of its boun
daries are drawn into one of the grove's trees or standing stones. The trunks of the trees or the surfaces of the stones contain twisted images of the dead trapped within. While trapped, these souls cannot be raised, resurrected, or reincarnated.
\par \tab To defend itself, the grove can summon any of its prisoners' spirits as ghosts or banshees (described in the }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 Monstrous Manual \'99}{\fs24\cgrid0 
). Each summoning takes two rounds, but only one ghost or banshee can exist at any time. Resanctifying the grove (described below) ends t
he curse and frees the trapped spirits, who now may be reincarnated, raised, or resurrected. Destroying the grove before resanctifying releases all the trapped spirits as malevolent ghosts or banshees to haunt the region henceforth.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Perpetual Season.}{\fs24\cgrid0  The 
grove, locked into a single season, never experiences a change in climate. Though a grove locked into winter isn't ever popular, a grove of perpetual spring or summer may seem like a blessing. While winter blizzards rage outside, the day is warm and sunny
 within a grove of perpetual summer; grass is always green, trees always leafy, and flowers ever blossoming. Nevertheless, druids consider this redundant setting horribly unnatural.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Hungry Trees.}{\fs24\cgrid0  The trees in this grove have been animated by a hunger for f
lesh. Treat the 2d8 hungry trees of this cursed grove as evil treants. Masquerading as normal trees, they suddenly attack anyone entering the grove. They never cross its borders unless attacked from outside the grove, though; in that case, they re-enter t
he grove after defeating (and consuming) foes.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Reclaiming Cursed or Defiled Groves
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab Druids whose sacred grove becomes defiled or destroyed must perform a ritual of atonement, plus find and punish the guilty party. Failing deprives druids of all granted powers and major access to priestly spheres.
\par \tab The first step in reclaiming a defiled gr
ove involves repairing any damage it has sustained: planting new trees, restoring damaged standing stones, and so on. Then, a druid must perform an uninterrupted daylong ceremony within the grove to ask for the renewed blessings of Nature.
\par \tab Reclaiming a cu
rsed grove poses additional difficulties. After performing the above steps, the druid must complete a task to balance the forces behind the curse. The nature of the task is up to the DM, but it usually involves a dangerous quest in a real or symbolic atte
mpt to "undo" the curse, punish those who caused it, or make amends for the act that led to it. After concluding the task, the druid must return to the grove to invoke Nature and cast a }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 remove curse}{\fs24\cgrid0  spell.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf13\cgrid0 Standing Stones
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 
\par \tab Standing stones are large, shape
d stones that rise from the ground to towering heights. In some cases, their presence in a forest, on a bleak moor, or atop a lonely hill automatically qualifies an area as a sacred grove, even if it lacks other natural beauty. Druids may have erected the
 standing stones, or they may mark a holy place that predates the druids' arrival in the area-- perhaps a site sacred to prehuman peoples (elves, for instance) or prehistoric tribes.
\par \tab Though sometimes stones stand alone, they more often join together to form various arrangements. A single standing stone is called a }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 megalith}{\fs24\cgrid0 --either a shaped slab or a more natural, tapering }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 obelisk}{
\fs24\cgrid0 . Two shaped stones placed upright with a third laid across their tops constitutes a }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 trilithon}{\fs24\cgrid0 . Several megaliths or trilithons frequently form patterns, usually circles or horseshoe shapes.
\par \tab Individual stones may weigh 5 to 25 tons each and stand 10 to 30 feet tall. A large circle may take a generation to build, unless powerful earth magic or suitable monsters (treants, earth elemen
tals, or giants) help in the construction. Because druids possess the necessary magic, they often create these monuments for their sacred groves.
\par \tab Standing stones fall into one of two categories: magical and nonmagical.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13\cgrid0 Nonmagical Standing Stones
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 \tab 
\par \tab Many standing stones have no innate magical properties, although they may have been built by magic. In "awakened" groves, these nonmagical stones may share in the general magic of the grove. The DM decides on the purpose, type, and number of stones.

\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Boundary Markers.}{\fs24\cgrid0  Stones can simply mark the grove's borders, a common practice when a circle of trees is inappropriate. Mountain druids, in particular, use stone circles to mark borders.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Natural Observatory.}{\fs24\cgrid0  The stones might serve as a primitive astronomical calcu
lator (as in the case of Stonehenge), their positions marking eclipses, equinoxes, and other important solar and lunar dates whose exact times remain important for religious reasons and for maintaining the agricultural calendar. Usually one such astronomi
c
al circle of stones exists in every major druidic domain. Creating such a circle requires two proficiencies: astrology and engineering. In some cases, these circles are relics left behind to mark the visits (and predict the eventual returns) of spelljammi
ng space druids.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Monuments. }{\fs24\cgrid0 
The lives of particularly notable historical figures can merit great megalith memorials. Sometimes treasure or a body lies buried under the stone. In rare instances, although the stone has no magic, the body beneath it rests in 
magical suspended animation--think of King Arthur, waiting for Merlin to awaken him.

\par \tab Magical standing stones can serve any of the nonmagical variety's purposes. Lesser magical sacred groves containing standing stones possess a 1
0% chance of having one with magical powers. This chance increases to 20% for groves with five or more stones, and 30% for groves with 25 or more stones. Standing stones within greater groves have triple the chance of being magical.
\par \tab Standing stones may be
come magical through association with druidic rites, divine intervention, or via the normal process used to create druidic magical items. DMs deciding that a stone has magic either pick its powers from those described below or roll on Table 6. Add a +1 bo
nus to rolls for standing stones that help form a trilithon.

\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Petrified Entity.}{\fs24\cgrid0 
 The magical stone is actually a huge being--often a giant or titan--that has been so weathered and overgrown with moss or ivy over the years its original humanoid form is no longer discernable. It radiates magic and may return to life if a }{
\i\fs24\cgrid0 dispel magic}{\fs24\cgrid0  or }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 stone to flesh}{\fs24\cgrid0 
 spell succeeds. Depending on its alignment and the reason it became petrified, the creature may feel either grateful or hostile to its rescuer. A petrified entity usually points to the work of dual-class wizard/druid.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Stone Guardian.}{\fs24\cgrid0  Once 
per day, the steward of the grove can order the stone to come to life for one turn per level of the druid. The animated stone fights as a 16 HD earth elemental, but if it leaves the grove it reverts to a normal stone and may not be reanimated until return
ed to the grove--a herculean task, since it weighs several tons! If injured, the magical stone heals at a rate of 1 hit point per turn--within the grove only.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Peaceful Stones.}{\fs24\cgrid0  The standing stones exert a calming influence on the earth. No }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 earthquake }{\fs24\cgrid0 spells
 may succeed within a radius that measures (in feet from the center of the stone or cluster) a distance equal to the number of stones in the circle. Since no earthquakes or volcanic eruptions occur in this area, peaceful stones often stand near volcanoes 
or faults. Removing them could spell disaster for nearby forests and towns!
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Speaking Stones.}{\fs24\cgrid0  Any druid can cause any standing stones in the grove to speak, per the stone tell spell. Characters can use this power as often as desired, but the stones speak fo
r no more than three rounds per day. Stewards use this power to learn whether intruders have visited the grove while they were away; druids who find a strange grove could use it to become familiar with the grove's history and keepers (if any).
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Trilithon Gate.}{\fs24\cgrid0 
 Characters passing under the stones may emerge from any other sacred grove in the world that also has a trilithon gate, no matter how distant. Those who have a particular gate in mind reach it; otherwise, characters come through a random gate. Anyone 
can travel via trilithon gate only once per day; it is impossible to go through and return again immediately.

\par }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 The following represents a summation of information on druids from the AD&D Original Edition }{\fs24\cgrid0 Player's Handbook}{\i\fs24\cgrid0  and the }{\fs24\cgrid0 Unearthed Arcana}{\i\fs24\cgrid0 
 reference book. Some of these rules may not coincide with the rules for druids in the AD&D 2nd Edition game.
\par }{\fs24\cgrid0 
\par \tab The druid is a subclass of the cleric, a neutral priest of nature who views good and evil, law and chaos, as ne
cessary and vital balancing forces. Druids hold trees (especially ash and oak) sacred, venerate the sun(s) and the moon(s), and serve as protectors of forests, wild plants, crops, and--to a lesser extent--animals and the human followers of their religion.
 They never destroy woodlands or crops, no matter what the situation (although druids could act to change the }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 nature}{\fs24\cgrid0 
 of an evil enchanted wood, for instance, without destroying it). Similarly, they avoid slaying wild or domestic animals, except as necessary
 for self-preservation and sustenance. However, druids rarely risk their lives to prevent damage to woodlands or animals--instead, they favor retribution after the fact, in a manner, time, and place of their own choosing.
\par \tab To become a druid, a character mu
st have a minimum Wisdom of 12 and Charisma of 15; if both these scores exceed 15, the druid gains a 10% bonus on earned experience. Human, elven, half-elven, and halfling PCs may be druids, although halflings and some types of elves are subject to level 
restrictions.
\par \tab Druids fight and save as clerics, but get a +2 bonus to save vs. fire or vs. electrical attacks. They can wear only leather armor and use only wooden shields. Their weapon options are limited to club, dagger, dart, hammer, khopesh, scimitar, 
scythe, sickle, sling, spear, and staff.
\par \tab A druid can use those magical items permitted to clerics, except for written items (books and scrolls) and weapons and armor forbidden to their class.

\par \tab The number of druids above 11th level in a given land is limited. (See Table 7.)
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Druid.}{\fs24\cgrid0  A land can have only nine 12th-level Drui
ds; when druids earn enough experience to achieve 12th level, they gain this level's powers only if the land presently has fewer than nine 12th-level Druids. A character also could gain the level by defeating one of the land's nine Druids in magical or ha
nd-to-hand combat. Losers that survive must drop just enough experience points to place them at the beginning of the next lower level (11th).
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Archdruid, Great Druid.}{\fs24\cgrid0  The same procedure applies when a 12th-level Druid gains enough experience to be
come an Archdruid, and when an Archdruid reaches Great Druid level. There are only three positions for Archdruids in a given region, and only one Great Druid.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Grand Druid.}{\fs24\cgrid0  Ranking above the Great Druids stands a single Grand Druid, the ultimate overseer o
f all a world's druids. Besides knowing six spells of each level, the Grand Druid has the ability to cast up to six spell levels (as one additional spell or in any combination that totals six levels--one 6th-level spell, six 1st-level spells, one 4th- and
 one 2nd-level spell, etc.).
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Hierophant.}{\fs24\cgrid0 
 The Grand Druid has an essentially political job, and most adventurers eventually tire of it. After attaining 500,000 experience points as a Grand Druid, the character may appoint any worthy Great Druid with 1,500,0
01 or more experience points as the successor. The former Grand Druid then rises to the 16th experience level, becoming a Hierophant. 
\par \tab As a Hierophant, the character relinquishes the Grand Druid's six bonus spell levels and, furthermore, loses all but 1 e
xperience point (yet remains at 16th level). The character then begins counting experience points again and progressing using Table 8 (next page).
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cgrid0 Attendants.}{\fs24\cgrid0  Each 12th- or higher-level druid acquires an entourage of devoted lower-level druids. The least 
experienced 12th-level druid has three 1st-level aspirants, the next has three 2nd-level ovates, and so on. The most experienced has as followers three initiates of the 7th circle. Three 10th-level initiates of the 8th circle always serve Archdruids, whil
e three 11th-level initiates of the 9th circle attend the Great Druid.
\par \tab The Grand Druid is attended by nine druids unattached to any specific land. Any character of at least Druid level may seek out the Grand Druid and offer service. Three of these servants, Archdruids, roam the world as the Grand Druid\rquote 
s personal agents and messengers. Each has four additional spell levels, as explained above.

\par \tab Druids use mistletoe as their religious symbol when casting spells, though holly and oak leaves both hold lesser mystic power for them as well.
\par \tab All druidic spells with a material component assume
 the caster uses greater mistletoe. Druids seek the mistletoe themselves on Midsummer's Eve, cut it with a gold or silver sickle, and catch the cuttings in a golden bowl before they touch the ground. Lesser mistletoe results when druids harvest the plant 
themselves in any other fashion. Borrowed mistletoe is any mistletoe not cut personally by the druid casting the spell.

A good many works of modern fantasy fiction deal with druids or druidlike figures who act to magically preserve and protect Nature. Some of the best are listed below, but many more Arthurian (Merlin was a druid!) or Celtic-inspired fantasies await in book

\par }\pard \nowidctlpar\tx0\adjustright {\i\fs24\cgrid0 The Mists of Avalon}{\fs24\cgrid0 , Marion Zimmer Bradley. The story of King Arthur, Merlin, and Morgan le Fay told from Morgan's point of view. Beautifully written.
\par 
\par }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 The Dreamstone}{\fs24\cgrid0 , C. J. Cherryh. Arafel, the last of the Sidhe and immortal protectress of the wood, makes a good model for an eccentric Guardian druid. Sequel: }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 The Tree of Swords and Jewels.
\par 
\par Moonheart}{\fs24\cgrid0 , Charles De Lint. This novel has a modern setting, but its compelling
 tale of bards, druids, shamans, and the meeting of Celtic and Amerind magic has relevance to any fantasy campaign--as do most of De Lint's other novels (especially }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 Greenmantle}{\fs24\cgrid0 ).
\par 
\par }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever}{\fs24\cgrid0  series, Steven R. Donaldson
. An outcast from our world becomes drawn reluctantly into a struggle to save the magical Land from evil. The forces rallied in defense of the Land hold ideas usable in a druidic campaign. Also relevant is the theme of protecting a world against a corrupt
ing evil.
\par 
\par }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 Moon of Gomrath}{\fs24\cgrid0 , Alan Garner. This tale, regarding the return of "wild magic" to England, contains useful enchantments.
\par 
\par }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 Mythago Wood}{\fs24\cgrid0 , Robert Holdstock. This award-winner full of powerful images brims with druidic magic and ancient mystery in Eng
land's woods. The Mythago Wood is the archetypal primal forest; mythagos themselves would make an exciting mystery encounter--and an interesting alternative to avatars. Sequel: }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 Lavondyss}{\fs24\cgrid0 .
\par 
\par }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 Druid}{\fs24\cgrid0 , Morgan Llywelyn. Clearly, this novel is superior historical fantasy.
\par 
\par }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 Nausicaa and the Valley of the Wind}{\fs24\cgrid0 , Hayao Miyazaki. Nausicaa, the heroine of this excellent science-fantasy comic (and \tab movie), resembles a gray druid with the Hivemaster kit.
\par 
\par }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 Moonshae and Druidhome trilogies}{\fs24\cgrid0 , Douglas Niles. These six books center around a druid who worships the Earthmother \tab in the Forgotten Realms setting.
\par 
\par }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 The Forest of Forever}{\fs24\cgrid0 , Thomas Burnett Swann. This is one of several novels by Swann that focuses on sylvan folk, dryads, \tab and the like within an ancient setting.
\par 
\par }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 Lord of the Rings}{\fs24\cgrid0 
, J. R. R. Tolkein. The encounters with the Old Forest, Tom Bombadil, Radagast, and Treebeard contain many ideas usable within a druidic campaign. Some think Gandalf resembles a druid far more than a wizard.
\par 
\par }{\i\fs24\cgrid0 The Seedbearers}{\fs24\cgrid0  trilogy, Peter Valentine. This series postulates a druid migration to Great Britain following the sinking of Atlantis. Its action continues up to Rome's destruction of the druids.
