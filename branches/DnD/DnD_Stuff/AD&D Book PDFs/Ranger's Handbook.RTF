\par }{\b\fs32\cf13 Introduction}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab The ranger is one of the most popular character classes in the AD&D\'ae game. A woodsman and tracker, as well as a dangerous fighter, he combines good c
ombat skills with a few extra abilities that give him many options and decisions during play. He boasts the courage and strength of a warrior and the stealth and self-reliance of a thief. He combines the druid's affinity for the outdoors with the devotion
 
and magical aptitude of a priest. He's a hunter, a tracker, and a survivalist. By temperament and by choice, he's a loner, often preferring the company of animals to people. Without question, he's one with nature, sworn to protect the inhabitants of the w
ilderness and preserve the integrity of the land.
\par \~\~\tab The ranger's origins can be traced to the time when isolated human settlements were first founded in areas of unclaimed wilderness, or in areas occupied only by savage humanoid tribes. Those who were at f
irst hunters, trappers, and guides were turned by the necessities of survival into canny wilderness warriors; and ultimately into the principle protectors of the scattered settlements of humans and demihumans, which had to fend off countless humanoid raid
s.
\par \~\~\tab 
Few in number, but effective far beyond the power of local militias or the occasional military patrol of a ruling lord, the rangers have kept a protective watch on the forward frontier of human expansion. There are seldom more than one or two to be fo
und in any place, but somehow, as a group, they manage to cover huge areas of the frontier. Where the tide of expansion has been turned back, they are the last to fight a desperate rear guard action against encroaching hordes of evil humanoids.
\par \~\~\tab In more 
civilized areas, it is common for kings and wealthy nobles to annex large tracts of forests for personal use. Some are maintained as private game preserves, others are harvested for the valuable timber. As a king's wilderness holdings grow, so does the ne
e
d to protect them. But suitable candidates are hard to come by. Often, from among local woodsmen and hunters, able-bodied and trustworthy retainers are recruited as forest justices or wardens. Skilled in the management of land, wilderness survival, and na
tural lore, the forest justices are charged with guarding the king's holdings, preserving his game from poachers and his subjects from outlaws and brigands.
\par \~\~\tab In other places, the local authorities have either lost control or become tyrannical. Perhaps the
 local order has broken down and the land is overrun by bandits or robbers. Perhaps a bad ruler has taken over and driven the peasantry beyond all possible tolerance. At such time a hero may arise, striding out of the wilderness, setting right the wrongs,
 returning a just overlord to power, and then disappearing back into wild and unknown lands. Such is the stuff of legends. Such is the legacy of the ranger.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf13 Overview
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab The ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS\'ae 2nd Edition }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook}{\fs24  and }{\i\fs24 DUNGEON MASTER\'ae Guide}{\fs24 
 contain all the basic information you need to create and play ranger characters. But for players wanting to go a bit deeper, }{\i\fs24 The Complete Ranger's Handbook}{\fs24 
 provides a wealth of detail that expands on that basic information, adding more options and rules to make your rangers come alive like never before.
\par \~\~\tab For instance, we'll examine the ranger's talents for tracking, animal empathy, and nature lore, suggesting methods for using these abilities in ways you might not have considered. If you've wondered wh
at a ranger does with his followers or exactly how he acquires them, you'll find the answers here. If you're tired of playing ordinary rangers, there's more than a dozen new character kits for your perusal, including the Giant Killer, the Pathfinder, and 
the Stalker. There are also plenty of new spells, proficiencies, and equipment to expand your ranger's horizons. Use what you like and ignore what you don't.
\par \~\~\tab Though much of this material will be of interest to the Dungeon Master, particularly the clarification of old concepts and the introduction of new rules,}{\i\fs24  The Complete Ranger's Handbook}{\fs24  is a supplement to the }{\i\fs24 
Player's Handbook}{\fs24 . Every word is intended for the players. Note, however, that all of material is optional, and none may be incorporated into a 
campaign without the express permission of the DM. These caveats aside, feel free to turn the page and enjoy.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf13 How to Use This Handbook}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \~\~\tab If you're a casual player, or have only a passing interest in the ranger character, begin by looking over the table 
of contents and noting any topics that catch your eye. Read the most appealing sections, skim over the rest, and consult with your DM about any new ideas you'd like to try. Later, you can read the entire book at your leisure, or keep it on the shelf as a 
reference, along with the previous handbooks in this series (including }{\i\fs24 The Complete Fighter's Handbook, The Complete Priest's Handbook, The Complete Wizard's Handbook, The Complete Thief's Handbook, The Complete Psionics Handbook}{\fs24 , and}{
\i\fs24  The Complete Bard's Handbook}{\fs24 ).
\par \~\~\tab Players who take their rangers seriously are advised to read the entire book. You'll discover a host of new ideas and character options, expanded tables, and tips for fine-tuning your role-playing techniques. As mentioned, all of the rules in t
his book must be cleared with the DM before you can use them in a game.
\par \~\~\tab Players of all persuasions should take a look at the new ranger character sheets located in the back of the book. The sheets have been custom-designed to record virtually every deta
il about a ranger character, and also feature a number of helpful notes to minimize the amount of time spent referring to the rulebooks. And speaking of the rulebooks, we've also compiled all of the key rules from the }{\i\fs24 DUNGEON MASTER Guide}{
\fs24  and Player's Handbook relevant to rangers; you'll find most of them in the first three chapters. We've also made every effort to elaborate on the most interesting concepts from the }{\i\fs24 DMG}{\fs24  and }{\i\fs24 PH}{\fs24 .
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf13 Before We Get Started . . .
\par }{\fs24 
\par . . . here are a few more points to keep in mind:
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 First Edition Rules
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab The ranger has undergone several changes since the publication of the 1st Edition AD&D\'ae rules. For that reason, those using the 1st Edition rules may find the ranger character described in these pages all but unrecognizable. Our su
ggestions: (1) take the plunge into the 2nd Edition rules, and become familiar with the 2nd Edition }{\i\fs24 DUNGEON MASTER Guide}{\fs24  and }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook}{\fs24 
 before considering the ideas in this handbook, or (2) ignore the chapter references in this book, as they all ref
er to the 2nd Edition rulebooks. Find the relevant material by consulting the indexes or contents pages of the original books, then carefully adapt the handbook rules of your choice to the style of your campaign. For reference, a summary of the 1st Editio
n ranger rules can be found in the Appendix of this book on page 122.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Proficiencies
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab The ideas in this book lean heavily on the concepts of weapon and nonweapon proficiencies introduced in Chapter 5 of the 2nd Edition}{\i\fs24  Player's Handbook}{\fs24 . If you haven't b
een using proficiencies in your campaign, we suggest you review the rules before proceeding with this book. (And if you're not using the proficiency rules, you ought to reconsider\emdash they're not that hard, and they make the game a lot more fun!).

\par 
\par }{\b\fs24 A Note About Pronouns}{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab 
\par \tab For convenience and clarity, masculine pronouns are used throughout this book. This in no way implies favoritism towards the male gender; in fact, males and females are equally represented in the ranger population. In all cases, read }{\i\fs24 he}{
\fs24  as }{\i\fs24 he}{\fs24  or }{\i\fs24 she}{\fs24 , and }{\i\fs24 his}{\fs24  as }{\i\fs24 his}{\fs24  and }{\i\fs24 her}{\fs24 .
\par }{\b\fs32\cf13 
\par 
\par Chapter 1: Character Creation
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab Let's begin our examination of the ranger with a look at the numbers--the statistics, adjustments, and level progressions that define the ranger class. This is the raw data common to all rangers, regardless of their backgrounds or personalities.

\par \~\~This chapter compiles the basic information in the }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook}{\fs24 
 regarding the ranger class, as well as the relevant material from the warrior section. In addition, some concepts, such as armor adjustments and level improvements, are clarified and expanded. A new concept, }{\i\fs24 primary terrain}{\fs24 , is also 
introduced.
\par \~\~In later chapters, we'll be discussing the ranger's special abilities in more detail, along with role-playing tips and options for refining his personality. But for now, we'll concentrate on the fundamentals, beginning with the most basic con
sideration of all--the ranger's class requirements.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf13 Ranger Requirements
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab It's tough being a ranger. The requirements are high, among the most demanding of any character class.

\par 
\par \~\~\tab As any player knows who's tried to roll up a ranger using the standard method (Method I, that is, described in Chapter 1 of the }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook}{\fs24 
), the dice seldom cooperate. In fact, it's just about impossible to generate the high die-rolls required for a ranger by this method. Method II isn't m
uch better, and though Methods III and IV improve the chances somewhat, the odds are hardly favorable. Only by using Methods V and VI do you have a fighting chance of rolling up a ranger from scratch.
\par \~\~Not all Dungeon Masters allow these alternative metho
ds, effectively restricting the number of rangers in their campaigns to a tiny minority. Players wanting ranger characters may find such restrictions frustrating, but remember that good DMs usually have their reasons for imposing these limitations. Perhap
s rangers aren't prevalent in the campaign world, or he may feel that rangers will introduce problems of balance; rangers are, after all, a most formidable character class.
\par \~\~However, if your DM is agreeable to having rangers in his campaign, Table 2 is a quick way to generate ranger ability scores. Roll 1d12 and use the statistics indicated.

\par \~\~\tab As
 rangers earn experience, they advance in level at a different rate than normal fighters. They acquire 1d10 hit points for each level up to 9th, and thereafter gain 3 hit points per level. The rates of advancement and hit point acquisition, along with the
 ranger's THAC0 scores (the number rolled on 1d20 to hit armor class 0), are listed in Table 3.

arious character types for hiding in shadows and moving silently.
\par \~\~\tab When attempting to hide in shadows, the ranger armor is assumed to cover his armor. Except for leather armor and elven chain mail, which can be concealed by normal clothing, a cloak or equivalent is needed to cover armor.
\par \~\~\tab If a ranger attempts to move silently or hide in shadows in an indoor or underground setting, his cumulative chance of success is halved. Further considerations and restrictions of a ranger's thief abilities are discussed in Chapter 2.

\par }{\b\fs28\cf13 Primary Terrain}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \~\~\tab Though rangers work well in all types of outdoor settings, most of them have one particular environment with which they are exceptionally familiar and feel especially comfortable. This environment, called the }{\i\fs24 primary terrain}{\fs24 
, may be similar to the area where the ranger grew up, received his training, or currently calls home. A ranger operates best in his primary terrain, thanks to his intimate knowledge of this type of setting.
\par \~\~\tab A ranger's primary terrain has no particular function in and of itself. Ra
ther, it's used to generate special benefits and other variables described elsewhere in this book. For instance, certain character kits in Chapter 4 grant bonuses to rangers when they occupy their primary terrain. A ranger's primary terrain also helps det
ermine his species enemy (Chapter 2) and followers (Chapter 3).
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Types of Primary Terrain}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \~\~\tab The concept of primary terrain presumes that similar survival techniques, modes of transportation, flora and fauna, and physical features prevail in similar enviro
nments, regardless of where in the world they're located. Therefore, primary terrain doesn't refer to a particular area, such as the High Moor of the FORGOTTEN REALMS\'ae
 setting, but to a general category of terrain, such as swamp or mountains. Conceivably, any combination of geographical features and climate could serve as a primary terrain, but for convenience, we'll confine the possibilities to nine general types:

\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Aquatic.}{\fs24  This terrain type includes all areas consisting primarily of water, such as lakes, oceans, and rivers. At the DM's discretion, this category may also include islands and coastal regions.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Arctic. }{\fs24 This includes any region covered with ice and snow where temperatures rarely rise above zero degrees. The North Pole is good example of arctic terrain.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Desert.}{\fs24 
 This includes any barren, flat areas covered with sand or hard-packed earth. Desert climates are extremely dry and hot, with daytime temperatures commonly in excess of 100 degrees, followed by much colder nights. Vegetation is usua
lly sparse, with special adaptations. Much of a desert may be unsettled or unexplored.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Forest.}{\fs24  This category comprises any woodland areas in temperate climates. At the DM's option, subarctic and subtropical climates may also be included. Forests abound 
with a variety of animal species, and vegetation flourishes. Not surprisingly, Forest is the primary terrain of choice for the majority of rangers.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Hill.}{\fs24  These are highlands, often wild and rough, which may or may not be forested. They usually form an intermediate zone between lowlands, such as Plains or Desert, and the highest lands, which are Mountain terrain.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Jungle.}{\fs24  These are tropical lands (including rain forests) overgrown with dense vegetation and trees, and teeming with animal life. Such regions are often hot, humid, and hostile to civilization.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Mountain.}{\fs24  This category includes terrain consisting of high rocky peaks, typically 4,000 feet or more above sea level, with sparse vegetation, severe slopes, and jagged cliffs. Subtropical to subarct
ic climates are typical, though a wide range of temperatures is possible.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Plains.}{\fs24  These are flat areas with stretches of low rolling land, including pastures, meadows, fields, and farmlands. Grazing animals are common here. Such regions are usually cove
red with grasses or scrub vegetation and are usually temperate in climate.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Swamp.}{\fs24  This includes bogs, marshes, and other low elevation areas with standing water or waterlogged soil. Many species of reptiles, birds, and insects live in these regions. Veg
etation grows in abundance. The climate may be oppressively hot and humid or cold and misty.
\par 
\par \~\~\tab An ambitious DM may wish to define these primary terrain categories more precisely. Instead of a general Aquatic primary terrain category, he may include both 
Freshwater Aquatic and Saltwater Aquatic, or distinguish them further by designating Temperate Freshwater Aquatic, Tropical Freshwater Aquatic, and so on. In such cases, the DM will need to adjust the primary terrain references elsewhere in this book; for
 instance, creating his own Freshwater Aquatic Species Enemy Table like the tables in Chapter 2.
\par \~\~\tab For most campaigns, however, the nine categories listed above should suffice. Though obvious differences exist, say, between saltwater and freshwater setting
s, a ranger's associated skills--the ability to swim, an understanding of aquatic ecology, a familiarity with water-breathing creatures--are applicable to both. Hence, a ranger whose primary terrain is Aquatic is presumably comfortable in a variety of wat
ery environments.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Choosing a Primary Terrain
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab The player chooses his ranger's primary terrain as part of the character creation procedure, subject to the DM's approval. Each ranger has only one primary terrain. Because the primary ter
rain reflects many years, perhaps a lifetime, of exposure to a particular environment, the primary terrain never changes. In exceptional campaign circumstances, however, the DM may allow a ranger to discard an old primary terrain and choose a new one; for
 instance, if a ranger whose primary terrain is Forest spends a few decades exploring the Great Glacier, his primary terrain may become Arctic. But as a rule, the primary terrain remains constant throughout a ranger's career.
\par \~\~\tab In most cases, the choice of
 the primary terrain will be obvious, as it usually derives from the ranger's background. It will be similar to the area where the ranger was raised, or the region where he's spent most of his life. The primary terrain of a ranger who grew up in the barre
n wastelands of the WORLD OF GREYHAWK\'ae Sea of Dust would probably be Desert. A ranger trained to oversee a private hunting reserve in the Wendle Wood of the DRAGONLANCE\'ae setting would probably have Forest as his primary terrain.
\par \~\~A ranger's primary terrain can be randomly rolled on Table 14. The results are subject to the approval of the DM.
\par \~\~Once the ranger has a primary terrain, it can be used as a basis for developing the character's personal history. If the primary terrain is Arctic, for example, consi
der how the ranger might have become familiar with such an extreme environment. Was he hired by a king to oversee a seal refuge? Abandoned in the Great Glacier as a youth when his explorer parents were killed by a polar bear? Accepted as an apprentice by 
a famous white dragon hunter? Let your imagination soar!

\par Chapter 2: Ranger Abilities
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab Regardless of whether they're wardens of private game reserves, arctic explorers, or freela
nce monster hunters, all rangers share a set of special abilities that distinguish them from other character classes. Just as wizards have an innate aptitude for casting spells and thieves have a natural talent for picking pockets, rangers have the inborn
 
ability to track other creatures, hide in shadows and move silently in outdoor settings, react to specific enemies, empathize with animals, understand the complexities of nature, survive in extreme conditions, build strongholds, and acquire followers. Qui
te a list--but that's what makes the ranger such an exceptional character.
\par \~\~We'll spend this chapter examining each of the ranger's abilities in detail, looking at their applications and special rules. The ranger's ability to attract followers--a topic com
plex enough to merit special attention--will be saved for the next chapter.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf13 Tracking
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab Thanks to his keen senses and thorough understanding of animal behavior, the ranger is an expert tracker. He reads an impression in the mud or a bend in a twig like w
ords on a printed page. He can determine the identity of his quarry and how fast it was traveling by the depth of a footprint. He can tell the size of a slug from the trail of slime it left behind. He can track an orc in the darkest forest, a rabbit thoug
h the thickest jungle, an escaped convict across the most desolate mountain range.
\par \~\~A ranger's tracking skills apply to characters as well as creatures, and to underground and interior settings as well as all types of outdoor environments. His tracking ski
lls are inherent; that is, he receives the Tracking nonweapon proficiency automatically at the outset of his career, expending no proficiency slots.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Pre-Conditions
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab A ranger can't just track anything, any time he likes. In order to track a particular quarry, the following conditions must be met:
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 1. The quarry must be capable of leaving a physical trail.}{\fs24  Elements of a trail may include footprints, bent twigs, waste matter, or any other physical signs that a ranger can follow. Certain categories of cre
atures--including swimming and flying creatures, small insects, and ghosts and other non-corporeal creatures--seldom leave physical evidence of their passage. In most cases, such creatures can't be tracked. However, since tracking involves all the senses,
 
not just sight, it's possible that the aroma of burning metal might linger after the passage of a particular spectre, or a ghost might reveal itself by its eerie voice, heard faintly in the distance. Still, only the most skilled rangers are capable of fol
lowing trails devoid of physical evidence, and the DM should allow such tracking in only the rarest of circumstances.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 2. The ranger must be able to find the trail.}{\fs24  If the trail is outdoors, the ranger must actually see the creature (he spots a fox dartin
g into the brush), notice obvious signs of his quarry (such as footprints or droppings), or hear reliable reports of the quarry's whereabouts ("Looking for that old silver dragon? She likes to drink from the pond by the twin palm trees."). If the trail is
 
indoors, the ranger himself must have seen the quarry within the last 30 minutes, and begin tracking from the location where the quarry was last seen. As always, the DM is the final arbiter as to whether the ranger has enough evidence to enable him to tra
ck the quarry.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Tracking Check
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab If the above conditions are met, the ranger can attempt to trail the quarry by making a Tracking check, using his Tracking score. The base Tracking score is equivalent to the ranger's Wisdom. Consult Tables 15-17 for other r
elevant modifiers; these tables may be used in place of Table 39 in Chapter 5 of the }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook}{\fs24 . In non-natural surroundings, the Tracking chances are halved.

\par \~\~\tab Should the ranger exceed the movement rate in Table 18--for instance, if a monster abruptly ambushes him and he's forced to run--he loses the trail.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 The modifiers change.}{\fs24  If the trail leads to a new terrain type, night falls, or any other change occurs 
that requires a new Tracking modifier (as described in Tables 15-17), the ranger loses the trail. The new conditions may dictate the use of modifiers reflecting a trail that is easier to follow, not more difficult, and DMs should consider applying a bonus
 in such conditions. Nevertheless, the new roll must still be made.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 A second track crosses the first. }{\fs24 Crossed trails mingle the physical signs of each, making tracking difficult. The DM determines if such a situation exists. If so, the ranger's efforts f
ail. (If the ranger wishes to continue tracking, as described below, he must decide which of the crossed trails to follow.)
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 The ranger becomes distracted.}{\fs24  An attack from a monster may interrupt the ranger's progress. Further, the ranger may intentionall
y choose to stop if he needs to rest, eat, or hold a discussion with his companions. Any of these interruptions qualifies as a distraction.
\par 
\par \~\~\tab When any of these conditions occur, the ranger loses the trail. To continue tracking the quarry, he must spend a
t least an hour exploring the immediate area for new signs of the trail. After an hour of searching, he makes a new Tracking check, based on a Tracking score calculated from the new conditions (if the illumination has changed from daylight to twilight, he
 
must now modify his Tracking score by -3). If other trackers assist the ranger, modify the tracking check by +1 per assistant; add the bonus to the Tracking score of the most adept tracker. This bonus is limited to +1 per 3 levels of the ranger (round up)
. If the check succeeds, the ranger may continue following the trail as before. If he fails the check, he has lost the trail for good.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Identification Check
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab By noticing details that other characters might overlook--the depth of a footprint, the thickness 
of a snapped branch, a hair caught in barbed bush--the ranger can deduce a sizeable amount of information about his quarry. The more skilled the ranger, the more information he deduces.
\par \~\~\tab Whenever a ranger makes a successful Tracking check, he may then attempt an Identification check. The Identification check uses the same score and modifiers as the Tracking check; essentially, the Identification check is a second Tracking check.

\par \~\~\tab If the Identification check is successful, the DM provides the ranger with
 some information about the quarry based on the guidelines in Table 19. The ranger's experience level determines the type of information he receives. The information is cumulative; that is, a 6th-level ranger who makes a successful Identification check re
ceives all types of information available to rangers of level 6 and below.
\par \~\~\tab The DM provides only general information, not exact details. At his discretion, the DM may give more precise or less specific information than suggested in Table 19. The informati
on may be ambiguous ("The tracks resemble those of a large bird, though they could have been made by some sort of reptilian creature.") but the DM shouldn't intentionally mislead the ranger (for instance, by telling him the tracks were definitely made by 
a bird when in fact they were made by a reptile). The parenthetical comments in Table 19 indicate how a DM might respond to a ranger studying tracks that were made by a pair of juvenile red dragons, each with a human rider.

\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab Not only is the ranger able to tr
ack the movement of others, he's also adept at concealing his own trail. If a ranger moves at half his normal movement rate, he may cover his footprints, avoid snapping twigs, and execute similar actions necessary to conceal his trail. When other characte
r
s, rangers included, attempt to track a ranger who has concealed his trail, they do so at a -5 penalty to their Tracking scores. (If a terrain-specialized ranger concealed his trail while moving through his primary terrain, others suffer a -7 penalty to t
heir Tracking scores.)
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf13 Hide in Shadows
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab By flattening his body or crouching in such as way as to blend into dark areas, and remaining perfectly still while doing so, the ranger can render himself nearly invisible in natural surroundings. This ability to
 hide in shadows works equally well in fields of tall grass, clumps of bushes, rocky hills, or any other wilderness area with dark or shaded terrain.
\par \~\~\tab When hiding, the ranger can conceal himself from attackers and eavesdrop on his enemies. He can hide ne
ar a well-traveled road and secretly observe passersby, or conceal himself near an enemy campsite, waiting for an opportune moment to steal their treasure or supplies.
\par \~\~\tab Table 8 in Chapter 1 gives the base chance for a ranger to hide in shadows, subject to the modifiers for race, Dexterity and armor (Tables 9-11). The following restrictions also apply:

\par \~\~\tab 
If the check is less than or equal to the ranger's adjusted hide in shadows score, the ranger has successfully concealed himself. He's essentially invisible to all others in the area, including his companions. He has hidden successfully until he changes l
o
cations; an attempt to hide in shadows in a different area requires a new die roll. Characters using spells or magical items that reveal hidden or invisible objects can detect him. Likewise, creatures who use their sense of smell to locate prey or other e
xceptionally keen senses have their normal chance of sniffing out a ranger hiding in shadows.
\par \~\~\tab If the check is greater than the ranger's hide in shadows score, he's failed to conceal himself and is as exposed as any normal character would be in the same a
rea. This doesn't necessarily mean that others will notice him, especially if the area of concealment provides a lot of natural cover, such as a cluster of bushes or the long shadow from a tall tree. However, the ranger may not know if he's succeeded or f
ailed until it's too late--for instance, if an NPC suddenly turns and charges.

\par }{\b\fs28\cf13 Species Enemy
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab Every ranger has a particular creature for which he harbors a deep loathing. Even an otherwise pacifistic ranger has no reservations about harming this creature. In fact, he may actively seek it out for the express purpose of destroying it.

\par \~\~\tab The creature that a ranger opposes above all others is called his }{\i\fs24 species enemy}{\fs24 . A ranger gains special combat modifiers when encountering his
 species enemy, reflecting both his knowledge of the creature and his intense emotions.
\par \~\~\tab The player must choose his ranger's species enemy before the character advances to 2nd level. The DM has final approval of the choice. Once the species enemy is dete
rmined, it never changes; the ranger retains the same species enemy for the duration of his career.
\par \~\~\tab Though it's not required, the DM may wish to suggest or assign a species enemy based on the ranger's personal history. Conversely, the player may use a D
M's choice of a species enemy to fill in some details about the character's early life. Here are a few ways a species enemy might reflect a ranger's background:
\par {\pntext\pard\plain\f3 \loch\af3\dbch\af0\hich\f3 \'b7\tab}}\pard \fi-360\li720\nowidctlpar\tx0\tx360{\*\pn \pnlvlblt\ilvl0\ls1\pnrnot0\pnf3\pnindent360 {\pntxtb \'b7}}\ls1\adjustright {\fs24 
The species enemy was responsible for a personal tragedy in the ranger's youth. The enemy ma
y have killed a ranger's friend or sibling, or may have destroyed the ranger's village and everyone in it. The ranger has vowed to avenge himself against the hated creature.
\par {\pntext\pard\plain\f3 \loch\af3\dbch\af0\hich\f3 \'b7\tab}}\pard \fi-360\li720\nowidctlpar\tx0\tx360{\*\pn \pnlvlblt\ilvl0\ls1\pnrnot0\pnf3\pnindent360 {\pntxtb \'b7}}\ls1\adjustright {\fs24 
The ranger had an intense phobic reaction against a particular creature, perhap
s as a result of a childhood trauma. When the ranger was an infant, for example, a snake may have slithered into his crib and tried to swallow him. After years of struggle, the ranger eventually overcame his phobia. In the process, the creature became his
 species enemy.
\par {\pntext\pard\plain\f3 \loch\af3\dbch\af0\hich\f3 \'b7\tab}}\pard \fi-360\li720\nowidctlpar\tx0\tx360{\*\pn \pnlvlblt\ilvl0\ls1\pnrnot0\pnf3\pnindent360 {\pntxtb \'b7}}\ls1\adjustright {\fs24 
A lord or king hired the ranger as a young man to rid the region of a particular creature. What began as a job became a personal vendetta, and the ranger has come to regard the creature as his species enemy.

\par }{\b\fs24 Optional Rule:}{\fs24 
 To determine a ranger's species enemy, consult Tables 20-29, rolling on the table corresponding to the ranger's primary terrain. The DM isn't confined to the creatures on the tables, and the tables can be expanded at will. At the DM's discretion, a skele
t
on or a wight may be an appropriate species enemy for a ranger whose primary terrain is Swamp or Mountains, and an ogre may be as appropriate in the Jungle as the Forest. The DM may also override any illogical selections; a shark, for instance, is a poor 
choice for an Aquatic ranger who's spent his life at a freshwater lake.
\par \~\~\tab A table is given for Underdark (deep subterranean) enemies, even though no ranger has the Underdark as a primary terrain.
\par 
\par \tab A ranger receives the following modifiers in regard to his species enemy:
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Attack Bonus.}{\fs24 
 Because of his special understanding of the species enemy's vulnerabilities and combat strategies, the ranger receives a +4 bonus to his attack rolls when fighting the creature. This bonus is in addition to any other bonuses the ranger normally receives.

\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Reaction Penalty.}{\fs24  So intense is the ranger's emotional response to the species enemy that it's nearly impossible for him to conceal it. For this reason, the ranger suffers a -4 penalty to all encounter reactions with the 
species enemy.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Combat Preference.}{\fs24 
 In most combat situations, the ranger will actively seek out his species enemy as the object of his attacks to the exclusion of all other potential opponents. If the party encounters three orcs and a troll, and the trol
l is the ranger's species enemy, the ranger will attack the troll and leave the orcs to his companions. If the ranger spots a troll in the wilderness, he may feel compelled to attack the troll unless his companions convince him otherwise or forcibly restr
ain him.
\par \~\~\tab This compulsion doesn't automatically override the ranger's good judgment or sense of duty. If a species enemy accidentally falls into a bottomless pit, the ranger won't jump in after it. If he hears rumors that a species enemy was sighted in a 
distant village, he won't abandon his party to investigate, although he may argue strongly for the party to check it out. If a companion cries for help, he will abandon his fight against a species enemy to come to the companion's aid, resuming his attacks
 against the species enemy when the companion is safe.
\par \~\~\tab The modifiers apply wherever the ranger encounters his species enemy, not just in the ranger's primary terrain. A ranger whose primary terrain is Desert and whose species enemy is the blue dragon wil
l receive a +4 combat bonus regardless of whether he meets a blue dragon in the desert, mountains, or anywhere else.
\par \~\~\tab Further, the modifiers apply only to the specific creature (or creatures) designated as the species enemy, including any leaders, nobles
, shamans, etc. If the species enemy is a blue dragon, the modifiers don't apply to black dragons, red dragons, or dragons of any other color. However, the modifiers affect blue dragons of all ages, from hatchlings to great wyrms. The ogre species enemy i
ncludes ogre leaders, shamans, and chieftains, but not ogre mages or merrows. (As a rule of thumb, if a variant creature has a separate listing in its }{\i\fs24 Monstrous Compendium}{\fs24 \'ae
 entry, it's not included as a species enemy). The DM is free to make exceptions to t
he lists in Tables 20-28 based on local conditions within the campaign. For instance, he may decide to include merrows as part of the ogre species enemy, or he may exclude advanced lizard men from the lizard man species enemy if campaign logic dictates.

\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab Many characters regard anim
als as non-thinking beasts that react purely on instinct, incapable of responding to reason. The ranger, on the other hand, sees animals as emotionally complex creatures whose fears and desires may be less sophisticated than those of humans, but are no le
ss real. This innate understanding of animal behavior gives the ranger a limited ability to influence their emotions and manipulate their behavior.
\par \~\~\tab The ranger knows the meaning of a twitching tail, a cocked head, a low growl. He knows that a snarling wol
f positioned in a crouch may be more frightened than hostile. If approached correctly, a hissing snake may slither away rather than strike. By calling on his animal empathy, a ranger can use soothing words and gestures to turn hostility to indifference, a
nd indifference to friendship.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Conditions
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab A ranger can't influence an animal's reactions at will. The following limitations apply:
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 The animal must be native to the real world; natural animals.}{\fs24 
 Rangers can't modify the reactions of supernatural creatures (skeletons and ghouls), magical creatures (basilisks and golems), or creatures of extra-planar origin (aerial servants and elementals). The ranger can affect giant animals.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 The animal must be intelligent, but not exceptionally so.}{\fs24 
 To respond to a ranger's words and gestures, the animal must be able to comprehend them. In practice, this means that a ranger can't use this ability to influence the behavior of non-intelligent animals (those with I
ntelligence scores of zero) such as centipedes or barracudas. Conversely, creatures of higher intelligence, such as leprechauns, ogres, and a paladin's warhorse, resist the ranger's }{\i\fs24 animal empathy}{\fs24 
. As a rule of thumb, rangers can only use this ability on natural animals whose intelligence ranges from Animal to Low (Intelligence score of 1 to 7).
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 The animal can't be the ranger's species enemy.}{\fs24  A ranger who confronts the species enemy is too overw
helmed by intense emotions to establish the proper empathy. Therefore, a ranger can never modify the reaction of his species enemy using this ability.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 The ranger must remain calm.}{\fs24  The ranger must move towards the animal quietly, slowly, and confidently,
 all the while speaking soothing words and making calming gestures. Fear cannot be shown, nor a weapon wielded, nor any action taken that might frighten or enrage the animal.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 The ranger must be distanced from the rest of the party.}{\fs24  If the ranger approaches w
ith  companions, the animal will react to the presence of all the characters, not just the ranger. The ranger's efforts to soothe the animal will go unnoticed. Ideally, the rest of the party will be out of the animal's sight when the ranger approaches. If
 this is impractical, the ranger's companions should be at least 10 feet behind him, remaining quiet and taking no actions that the animal might interpret as hostile.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 The animal must be able to hear and see the ranger. }{\fs24 The ranger must be in plain sight f
or the animal to size up; the ranger may not be concealed in the brush, hidden in shadows, or have erected any type of physical barrier between himself and the animal. The animal must also be able to hear the ranger, meaning that the area must be relative
l
y quiet, free of distracting or disturbing sounds. In most cases, the ranger must be within a few feet of the animal, or close enough for the animal to see the ranger's eyes. The DM may make exceptions in special circumstances. For instance, if the ranger
 
approaches an animal in total darkness, the DM may rule that soothing words are sufficient to calm the animal. In situations where silence is imperative, gestures alone may suffice. However, in all cases, the ranger must still be relatively close to the a
nimal to modify its reaction.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 The ranger must soothe the animal for an uninterrupted period.}{\fs24  A ranger can't attempt to soothe an animal that's charging or attacking; the animal must be stationary or moving only slightly (a pacing wolf, a weaving serpent)
. Once the ranger moves close to the animal, the creature must be soothed for 5-10 (1d6+4) uninterrupted rounds; the DM may increase this time if the animal is unusually anxious or exceptionally hostile. (This time can be lapsed by the DM if nothing else 
is going on.)
\par 
\par \~\~\tab A ranger who meets these conditions can use animal empathy in an attempt to modify the animal's reactions. Though the game result is the same, technique differs depending whether the animal is wild or domestic.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Wild Animals
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab This group includes animals not normally domesticated, such as lions, snakes, and rats. It also includes domesticated animals that have been trained to attack, such as dogs.
\par \~\~\tab Before the ranger attempts to soothe a wild animal, the DM must determine the animal's cu
rrent attitude, taking into account its natural temperament (Is it naturally aggressive, or inclined to flee rather than fight?), immediate conditions (Did it just wake up? Is it sick or wounded? Hungry?) and pre-existing circumstances (Has it recently be
e
n harassed or befriended by characters similar in appearance to the ranger? Is it guarding its nest or lair?) The DM should then select the animal's current attitude from Table 30. The attitude should not be announced ("The wolf is Cautious."). Instead, c
learly describe the animal's appearance and behavior and let the ranger come to his own conclusions ("The wolf paces back and forth, eyes darting. It begins to snarl as you approach.").

ly, and behaves accordingly. This new reaction applies only to the ranger. An animal that the ranger changed from Threatening to Cautious may still behave in a Threatening manner to other members of the party, particularly if another character decides to 
i
nterfere with the ranger's efforts or otherwise draws attention to himself. However, as long as the ranger stays near the animal and continues to soothe it, the animal's attention will remain focused on the ranger, and it will remain Cautious. After the r
anger leaves the area, the animal's attitude remains altered for a short time (from a few minutes to an hour, as decided by the DM) before it reverts to its original disposition.
\par \~\~\tab If the animal succeeds in its saving throw, it resists the ranger's efforts
 and its attitude remains unchanged. The ranger notices no significant difference in the animal's behavior. An Indifferent animal continues to ignore the ranger, a Hostile animal may suddenly charge him. The ranger can't make a second attempt to modify it

\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Domestic Animals
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab This group includes animals that have non-hostile dispositions and are routinely domesticated, such as horses and dogs. It also includes formerly wild animals, such as bears and monkeys, that have been tamed and now are comfortable around people.

\par \~\~\tab Such animals are presumed to be Frightened, Friendly, Indifferent, or Cautious. Regardless of their initial disposition, when a ranger approaches and soothes them, they become Friendly. No saving throws are necessary; this change
 is automatic. It's also permanent, so long as the ranger stays in sight of the animal. If the ranger leaves the area, the animal reverts to its original disposition a short time later (within a few minutes to an hour).
\par \~\~\tab The attitude change applies to th
e ranger only; an Indifferent dog feels Friendly to the ranger but remains oblivious to the ranger's companions. A Cautious horse is Friendly to the ranger and will carry him on its back, but bucks furiously if anyone else attempts to mount it.

\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Nature Lore
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab Though the experiences of a ranger living in an arctic wasteland may differ dramatically from one who makes his home in a jungle, both have spent many years observing the patterns of nature,
 and both have arrived at similar conclusions about the relationship between living things and their environment.
\par \~\~\tab All rangers, then, have an inherent understanding of natural lore, encompassing a broad set of principles involving conservation, ecology, 
and natural order. Though not every ranger knows specific details about particular situations, all of them understand the general concepts at work. Some examples:
\par {\pntext\pard\plain\f3 \loch\af3\dbch\af0\hich\f3 \'b7\tab}}\pard \fi-360\li720\nowidctlpar\tx0\tx360{\*\pn \pnlvlblt\ilvl0\ls1\pnrnot0\pnf3\pnindent360 {\pntxtb \'b7}}\ls1\adjustright {\fs24 
The plant and animal life in any given habitat tend to be interdependent. The butterfly pollinates the flower, the flower produces nectar to feed the butterfly.
\par {\pntext\pard\plain\f3 \loch\af3\dbch\af0\hich\f3 \'b7\tab}}\pard \fi-360\li720\nowidctlpar\tx0\tx360{\*\pn \pnlvlblt\ilvl0\ls1\pnrnot0\pnf3\pnindent360 {\pntxtb \'b7}}\ls1\adjustright {\fs24 
Animals and plants adapt to natural changes in the environment. Grass becomes dormant in the winter and grows again in the spring. A wolf's fur thickens as the temperature drops, and thins when the weather becomes warmer.
\par {\pntext\pard\plain\f3 \loch\af3\dbch\af0\hich\f3 \'b7\tab}}\pard \fi-360\li720\nowidctlpar\tx0\tx360{\*\pn \pnlvlblt\ilvl0\ls1\pnrnot0\pnf3\pnindent360 {\pntxtb \'b7}}\ls1\adjustright {\fs24 
To avoid ruining the land, natural resources used by man must be replenished. If trees are harvested in a forest, new trees should be planted in their place.
\par }\pard \nowidctlpar\tx0\tx360{\*\pn \pnlvlcont\ilvl0\ls0\pnrnot0\pndec }\adjustright {\fs24 \~\~\tab A ranger's knowledge of natural lore enhances his re
verence for all living things. In practical terms, it allows him to recognize ecological and environmental problems, both actual and potential. In some cases, he may be able to offer suggestions for correcting them.
\par \~\~\tab There are no hard and fast rules for 
determining the extent of a ranger's natural lore and its application. The DM must decide how much a particular ranger knows on a case by case basis, taking into account the ranger's training, background, and primary terrain. In most situations, experienc
e is the main factor; the higher the ranger's level, the more he's likely to know.
\par \~\~\tab Table 31 provides natural lore guidelines for rangers of various levels. The information is cumulative; a 7th-level ranger also knows the information available to lower-le
vel rangers. Keep in mind that these are generalizations; a 2nd-level ranger who was raised on a farm may know as much about the ecology of growing crops as another ranger of 10th level. By way of illustration, the parenthetical comments indicate what the
 ranger might know if attempting to figure out why crops no longer grow in a once-fertile farmland.

\par \tab If th
e DM is stumped as to whether a ranger knows a particular piece of information, he may require the ranger to make a Wisdom check, adding bonuses or penalties to the roll depending on the relative difficulty of the question. For instance, knowing if a part
i
cular substance will work as a fertilizer is a relatively easy question, requiring no penalty to the roll. Knowing which specific crops the fertilizer will nourish is a more difficult question, and a penalty to the roll may be in order. In all cases, the 
DM should use common sense. A ranger who's never been out of the desert won't know much about the effects of a hurricane on a coastal environment, regardless of his level.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Survival
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\tab The ranger is exceptionally skilled at surviving harsh conditions associ
ated with his primary terrain. In game terms, the ranger is considered to automatically have the Survival proficiency in his primary terrain. This skill costs no proficiency slots. A ranger can spend slots in the Survival proficiency to acquire survival s
kills in environments other than his primary terrain.
\par \~\~\tab The ranger's survival skill helps in the following ways, all of which apply only in the primary terrain. In certain cases, the DM may require a Survival check (which is equivalent to an Intelligence c
heck). A ranger rolling less than or equal to his Intelligence score on 1d20 succeeds in the check.
\par {\pntext\pard\plain\f3 \loch\af3\dbch\af0\hich\f3 \'b7\tab}}\pard \fi-360\li720\nowidctlpar\tx0\tx360{\*\pn \pnlvlblt\ilvl0\ls1\pnrnot0\pnf3\pnindent360 {\pntxtb \'b7}}\ls1\adjustright {\fs24 
The ranger knows the basic precautions necessary to enhance the chances of survival, and can instruct and assist any companions accordingly. For example,
 a ranger whose primary terrain is Mountains realizes that physical exertion in high altitudes may result in headaches and fatigue (due to low air pressure). A Desert ranger knows that in arid climates, it's better to rest in the still air than exposed to
 
a strong wind (wind promotes evaporation from the skin, increasing the degree of dehydration). An Aquatic ranger understands that saltwater can't be used for drinking. An Arctic ranger realizes that temporary protection can be had from a bitter wind by tu
n
neling inside a snow drift. This knowledge doesn't guarantee survival by any means; it merely improves the odds.  If the ranger wonders about any particular piece of information, the DM will decide if  he knows it, requiring a Survival check if necessary.

\par {\pntext\pard\plain\f3 \loch\af3\dbch\af0\hich\f3 \'b7\tab}}\pard \fi-360\li720\nowidctlpar\tx0\tx360{\*\pn \pnlvlblt\ilvl0\ls1\pnrnot0\pnf3\pnindent360 {\pntxtb \'b7}}\ls1\adjustright {\fs24 
The ranger can stave off starvation by finding small amounts of food. A successful Survival check locates enough food to feed himself or one other character. He can locate food in this way once per day.
\par {\pntext\pard\plain\f3 \loch\af3\dbch\af0\hich\f3 \'b7\tab}}\pard \fi-360\li720\nowidctlpar\tx0\tx360{\*\pn \pnlvlblt\ilvl0\ls1\pnrnot0\pnf3\pnindent360 {\pntxtb \'b7}}\ls1\adjustright {\fs24 The ranger can find enough water to keep himsel

The ranger can interpret subtle changes in the environment to anticipate natural disasters. A Plains ranger can recognize t
he appearance of the sky associated with a coming tornado. A Mountain ranger can identify the rumbling sound that precedes an avalanche. The DM may require Survival checks to verify a ranger's interpretations.
\par }\pard \nowidctlpar\tx0\tx360{\*\pn \pnlvlcont\ilvl0\ls0\pnrnot0\pndec }\adjustright {\fs24 
\par }{\b\fs24 Optional Rule:}{\fs24  One way in which a DM can use 
the Survival ability in a "quick-and-dirty" fashion is to set up special penalties (cumulative penalties for fatigue for fatigue or exposure) in especially harsh climes.  A party with a ranger or one that is properly prepared and outfitted, simply avoids 
the potential penalties.  Those who are unprepared take the penalties until the DM decides they have acclimated to the setting, or until they take other appropriate actions determined by the DM.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf13 Strongholds
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab Like fighters, rangers have the ability to build and maintain castles, forts, and strongholds. Unlike fighters, rangers are not joined by free soldiers or other special followers in doing so.
\par \~\~\tab Theoretically, any ranger can build a stronghold. In practice, most rangers who build them are 9th level o
r higher, since rangers of lower level usually lack the necessary resources, reputation, and skills. A DM may allow a lower-level ranger to have a stronghold under exceptional circumstances; for instance, a ranger might come into an inheritance, or a grou
p of peasants might build a castle in gratitude for his assistance.
\par \~\~\tab Some rangers acquire strongholds in cooperation with the local king or ruler. The ranger begins the process by petitioning the ruler for permission to build a stronghold in a particular 
area. If the ranger demonstrates good will and has a reputation for trustworthiness and strong leadership, the ruler usually grants permission. In exchange for this permission, the ranger may have to pay an annual tax, or make himself available to serve i
n the ruler's military forces in times of war. If the ranger meets his obligations, the ruler may loan royal forces to the ranger if his territory is invaded or his stronghold besieged.
\par \~\~\tab More commonly, rangers prefer to build their strongholds in the unse
ttled wilderness, beyond the sovereignty of any government. Though free of obligations to a ruler, the ranger must also fend for himself in times of peril; if an army of orcs lays claim to the ranger's territory, the ranger is on his own.
\par \~\~Because a range
r's stronghold gains him no special followers, it tends to be significantly smaller and less elaborate than that of a fighter of comparable level. Though a fighter may receive money by selling products produced on his land, taxing settlers, or charging re
nt, these options are rarely available to rangers. In most cases, a ranger's stronghold generates only a modest income, if any.
\par \~\~\tab Guidelines for building and maintaining strongholds are beyond the scope of this book. For more information, you might investigate the}{\i\fs24  DMRG2 Castle Guide}{\fs24 
, which includes details of castle construction along with a number of standard floor plans.
\par \~\~Though most rangers prefer castles and forts made of wood and stone, these are by no means the only types available. Other possibiliti
es include tree houses (in Forest and Jungle terrain), fortified encampments (Desert), observation platforms (Mountains), floating citadels (Swamp and Aquatic), and ice towers (Arctic).
\par }{\b\fs32\cf13 
\par 
\par Chapter 3: Followers
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab 
Perhaps the ranger's most interesting ability is the chance to attract unusual followers. Unlike fighters and other character classes that acquire followers, the ranger's followers include animals and magical creatures as well as humans and demihumans. In
 
fact, it's possible that all of a ranger's followers may be animals, which can result in unexpected benefits (strangers aren't as likely to mess with a ranger accompanied by a wolf pack) as well as unforeseen complications (ever try getting a room at an i
nn with a bear trotting behind you?).
\par \~\~\tab Humans and demihumans (and magical creatures) are drawn to a ranger because of his sterling reputation. They serve as followers out of loyalty and respect, remaining true to the ranger so long as he treats them decen
tly. In this way, such followers are different from normal hirelings and mercenaries who serve for pay.
\par \~\~\tab The motivations of animal followers are less obvious. Animals have no conception of what constitutes a reputation, sterling or otherwise. Instead, an
imals bond to rangers by instinct. The nature of this bond lies somewhere between the relationship of an infant animal and its parent (picture a baby duck contentedly swimming behind its mother), and a master and his pet (think of a dog's affection for th
e person who provides him with companionship). If the ranger honors the bond, the follower will often remain loyal for its entire life.
\par \~\~\tab It's important to keep in mind that this bond has no magical basis. The follower stays with a ranger of its own voliti
on, not from some supernatural compulsion, and may leave if conditions become intolerable. Likewise, a ranger doesn't control the actions of his followers, though he may instruct human followers to carry out specific functions, and train animal followers 
to perform various tricks and tasks.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf13 Gaining Followers
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab It's strictly up to the Dungeon Master to determine when a ranger receives his followers, how many he's entitled to, and the circumstances under which they appear. Though the player is free to express his preferences, the DM has the final word.

\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Number of Followers
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab As soon as a ranger reaches 10th level, the DM secretly rolls 2d6. The result indicates the maximum number of followers the ranger will receive over the course of his career. This rol
l is made only once, and the number is never revealed to the player. The DM should make a note of the number on a sheet of paper; he can use the same sheet to keep track of the followers as the ranger receives them to make sure he doesn't exceed his allot
ment. The player should also keep track of his ranger's followers; the record sheets at the end of this book are designed for this purpose.
\par \~\~Lost followers are not replaced. If a ranger has a limit of two followers and both are killed, he'll never receive another follower for the rest of his career.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Identity of Followers
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab After the DM makes the 2d6 roll to determine the number of followers, it's time to think about who or what they're going to be. He should begin by deciding the identity of the first tw
o or three followers, so that he can make plans to smoothly introduce them into his campaign. He can determine the identities of the remaining followers later, whenever he likes.
\par \~\~\tab To determine the identity of followers, the DM may roll on Table 19 in Chapter 3 of the }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook}{\fs24 
, use Tables 33-43 in this chapter, or simply choose any particular creature he likes. Regardless of the method preferred, the DM should keep the following restrictions and recommendations in mind:

re are advantages and disadvantages to each method. For instance, if you're only using the primary terrain table, a Desert ranger is likely to end up with a collection of creatures he's comfortable with, but he may have a hard time acquiring any followers
 
at all if the campaign keeps him out of arid environments. Using the local table ensures that a ranger will have regular access to followers, but he may end up with a bizarre menagerie (imagine a Desert ranger with a merman, skunk, and baboon!). Regardles
s of which method you prefer, it's best to settle on one at the outset of a campaign and use it throughout.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 How and When Followers Appear
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab To give the DM maximum flexibility for introducing followers into his campaign, no fixed rules exist for determini
ng exactly when they show up. Once the appropriate level is attained, followers should trickle in, one at a time, throughout the course of the ranger's career. As a rule of thumb, assume that a new follower makes an appearance no more than once every few 
months.
\par \~\~\tab Keep the terrain in mind when deciding how often animal or special followers appear. Regions heavily populated with animals, such as dense jungles or lush forests, are more likely to generate such followers than barren mountains or bleak arctic l
andscapes. As seen in Tables 33-43, certain types of followers tend to show up in particular areas; for instance, a ranger is more likely to acquire a camel follower in the desert than in the jungle. But exceptions abound; a ranger might encounter a camel
 that accidently wandered into the plains, or encounter one on display in a zoo in the mountains. As long as the DM creates an explanation, animal and special followers can show up in a surprising variety of places.
\par \~\~\tab Regardless of when and where followers show up, the DM should strive to work their appearance into the events of a campaign. Here are a few situations that may result in a new follower:
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Use of Proficiencies, Special Abilities, or Spells.}{\fs24  After the successful use of the animal handling or an
imal training proficiency, the affected creature might take a liking to the ranger and offer itself as a follower. This may also occur after a ranger uses his animal empathy ability. Likewise, an animal enchanted by a spell such as }{\i\fs24 
animal friendship}{\fs24  might linger in the area after the magical effects wear off. In any case, the effects of the proficiency or spell no longer apply; the animal in question has decided of its own accord to stick around.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Planned Encounters.}{\fs24  As part of an adventure, the DM may de
cide to stage one or more encounters featuring potential followers. For instance, the party may need to explore a cave containing a curious bear, search for a sunken treasure chest surrounded by friendly dolphins, or navigate a jungle filled with mischiev
ous baboons. Assuming that the ranger doesn't inadvertently sabotage the encounter--he kills the bear or avoids the treasure chest--this is one of the most dependable methods for introducing new followers.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Hunting or Shopping.}{\fs24  When shopping for a new mou
nt, a ranger may be surprised to find one of the horses in the stable noses its way to the front, as if presenting itself for purchase. When hunting for the evening meal, the ranger might suddenly notice that a deer or other game animal is following }{
\i\fs24 him}{\fs24 . Perceptive rangers may realize that these animals are offering themselves as followers.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Character Interaction.}{\fs24  The ranger spares a foe, only to be adopted by the grateful creature. An NPC youth of long acquaintance (perhaps one  rescued on a previous adv
enture) decides to take ranger training with the PC as a mentor.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Abrupt Appearance.}{\fs24  For no apparent reason, an creature may present itself to the ranger. Hiking through the woods, the ranger becomes aware of a brownie sauntering behind him. The ranger w
akes up with a sleeping fox curled up on his chest. A pseudodragon flutters from the sky and perches on the ranger's shoulder. From a purist's point of view, this is the least satisfying option for introducing followers, as it doesn't arise directly from 
the events of the story. But it's an acceptable method when all else fails.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Acquiring Specific Followers
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab Clearly, some types of followers are more desirable than others. Most rangers will find a horse to be more useful than a rabbit, a dog more advanta
geous than a mouse. Even in the best of situations, a snake or scorpion follower may be more trouble than it's worth.
\par \~\~\tab There's not much
 a ranger can do to ensure he gets the type of followers he wants. Becoming a follower is essentially a choice made by the animal or NPC, not the ranger. Though the ranger can influence animal behavior to a certain degree, a ranger can't force a particula
r creature to become a follower against its will.
\par \~\~\tab However, a ranger can increase his chances of acquiring specific followers in several ways. The easiest and most obvious way is to go where the animals live. A ranger who wants a polar bear follower shoul
d go to arctic. Farms and market places are good sources of domestic animals, while zoos and carnivals may stock a wide variety of exotic creatures.
\par \~\~\tab The frequent use of the animal training or animal handling proficiencies, as well as the }{\i\fs24 animal empathy}{\fs24  special ability, brings the ranger in close contact with potential followers. Spells such as }{\i\fs24 locate animals}{
\fs24  or }{\i\fs24 plants}{\fs24  can lead him to particular species, while the }{\i\fs24 call animal follower}{\fs24  spell (described in Chapter 6) may successfully summon a follower.
\par \~\~\tab Note that such efforts don't guarantee the arrival of a follower in any way. In many campaigns, however, extra efforts made to locate followers increases the likelihood of their appearance.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Recognizing Animal Followers
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab A good DM tries to capture the be
havior of real animals, and doesn't just announce to the ranger that an animal follower just presented itself. Instead, the DM describes the actions and behavior of the animal and allows the ranger to come to his own conclusions.
\par \~\~\tab How does a ranger know if a particular animal is indeed a follower? Here are some signs:
\par {\pntext\pard\plain\f3 \loch\af3\dbch\af0\hich\f3 \'b7\tab}}\pard \fi-360\li720\nowidctlpar\tx0\tx360{\*\pn \pnlvlblt\ilvl0\ls1\pnrnot0\pnf3\pnindent360 {\pntxtb \'b7}}\ls1\adjustright {\fs24 
The animal doggedly follows him. If the ranger climbs a steep mountain, the animal struggles to keep up. If he goes swimming, the animal waits on the shore.
\par {\pntext\pard\plain\f3 \loch\af3\dbch\af0\hich\f3 \'b7\tab}}\pard \fi-360\li720\nowidctlpar\tx0\tx360{\*\pn \pnlvlblt\ilvl0\ls1\pnrnot0\pnf3\pnindent360 {\pntxtb \'b7}}\ls1\adjustright {\fs24 The animal shows signs of a
ffection. A lion rubs against the ranger's legs, a wolf licks his face, a horse nuzzles him.
\par {\pntext\pard\plain\f3 \loch\af3\dbch\af0\hich\f3 \'b7\tab}}\pard \fi-360\li720\nowidctlpar\tx0\tx360{\*\pn \pnlvlblt\ilvl0\ls1\pnrnot0\pnf3\pnindent360 {\pntxtb \'b7}}\ls1\adjustright {\fs24 
The animal is uncharacteristically docile. A tiger sits peacefully in the grass while the ranger has dinner. A wild dog yawns when the ranger approaches, but growls when the ranger's companion comes near.
\par }\pard \nowidctlpar\tx0\tx360{\*\pn \pnlvlcont\ilvl0\ls0\pnrnot0\pndec }\adjustright {\fs24 \~\~\tab 
A day or two spent observing such actions should convince even the most skeptical ranger that he's acquired a follower. The DM may verify this conclusion, but is under no obligation to do so. If doubt remains
 in the ranger's mind, he may be able to ask a companion to use }{\i\fs24 speak with animals}{\fs24  or a similar spell to verify the animal's status.
\par \~\~\tab Human and demihuman followers tend to express their admiration openly and unambiguously, fawn over the ranger's every ut
terance, gazing admiringly at him, or offer their assistance at every opportunity. Unless he's exceptionally suspicious or just plain dense, a ranger should have much less trouble recognizing human and demihuman followers.

\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 General Behavior of Followers}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \~\~\tab This section pertains to animal followers, as do the three sections which follow--Training Animal Followers, Follower Loyal
ty, and Parting Company. Information relevant to human and demihuman followers can be found in the last section of this chapter.
\par 
\par \~\~\tab What exactly does an animal follower }{\i\fs24 do}{\fs24 , anyway?
\par \~\~\tab 
At first, animal followers do little more than that--they follow. While an avian follower may perch on the ranger's shoulder for a few miles or a dog may scout up ahead, for the most part, followers linger behind, keeping perhaps 10-20 feet between themse
lves and the ranger.
\par \~\~\tab In general, an animal follower attempts to accompany the ranger wherever he goes. If the ranger enters a cave, the follower goes in after him. If the ranger paddles a canoe, the follower attempts to swim alongside. If the follower ca
n't swim, it waits on shore for the ranger to return. If the follower is too big to squeeze through an underground passage, it may surface and wait for the ranger outside.
\par \~\~\tab Likewise, if a ranger moves at a pace faster than the follower can maintain, the 
follower will attempt to pursue as best it can. When a ranger interrupts his travels--for instance, if he stops to camp--he may give the lagging follower enough time to catch up. If a follower is unable to rejoin the ranger because of a lost trail (the an
i
mal hasn't seen the ranger in several days and can no longer track him), physical barriers (the animal is incapable of following the ranger across a vast river) or inhospitable terrain (a seafaring ranger has left for the shore, abandoning a water-breathi
ng follower), the follower is considered to be released; see the Parting Company section below for details.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Routine Activities
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\tab \~For the most part, an animal follower can take care of itself. Assuming there's an adequate supply of game or edible vegetati
on in the area, the animal will hunt or graze as necessary to keep itself fed. It will find its own water, keep itself groomed, and rest when tired. If the ranger marches by day and rests by night, nocturnal animals will either reverse their normal sleepi
ng patterns and sleep when the ranger sleeps, or sleep by day and catch up with the ranger in the evening.
\par \~\~\tab In extreme circumstances, an animal follower may depend on the ranger for routine care. If an animal follower accompanies a ranger into a city or o
ther area where it's unable to hunt, the ranger will probably have to supply food. In a hot desert, a ranger may need to share his water. Wounded or ailing animals sometimes require medical attention. If an animal fails to receive adequate care, it may ab
andon the ranger (see the Parting Company section).
\par \~\~\tab As an animal becomes more attached to a ranger, it may require extra attention or reassurance. Usually, an animal lets the ranger know when it needs attention by rubbing against him, frolicking in front
 of him, or whining incessantly. Usually, a ranger can soothe an anxious animal follower by playing with it for a few minutes, offering some comforting words, or stroking its fur. If the ranger makes a habit of ignoring a follower, it may abandon him.

\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Procreation
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\tab \~Most healthy animals have a powerful instinct to procreate. On occasion, a follower will disappear into the wilderness to seek a mate. Usually, the follower returns in a few hours, or at most, a few days. However, so strong is the urge that th
e follower may abandon the ranger altogether if it has to travel long distances to find a suitable partner. Also, the quest for a mate is not without risk; a male follower may die while fighting a rival for the attentions of a desirable female (which may 
account for why some followers mysteriously disappear and never come back). But more often than not, a follower will complete its liaison without incident, rejoining its ranger unharmed and content.
\par \~\~\tab Should a female animal follower give birth, the offspri
ng don't automatically become followers. Initially, offspring are considered "followers" of the parent, as their relationship with their mother more or less parallels the mother's relationship with the ranger. As the offspring mature, they may wander away
 to start lives of their own, or they may stay and become followers, as decided by the DM. Offspring who become followers count against the ranger's normal limit.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Combat
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab Animal followers will rarely defend their rangers against attack unless trained to
 do so (see the Training Followers section below), especially if the opposition is supernatural or uses fire. In general, a follower is mainly concerned with its own safety, fighting only when necessary to protect itself. An exceptionally violent animal m
a
y relish any opportunity to attack, and some will stand guard over or attempt to drag away their incapacitated ranger, but most of the time, a follower is more likely to take cover or retreat than engage in combat. The DM determines the combat reactions o
f a follower just as he would for any animal in the game.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Communication
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab When a ranger acquires an animal follower, he gains no special way of communicating with it. Unless the ranger trains the creature to respond to specific vocal sounds or physical s
ignals, the follower passively accompanies the ranger on his travels, oblivious to his commands.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Reactions to Others
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab Animal followers feel loyal and friendly to their rangers. Most animal followers would no more harm their rangers than they would thei
r own mothers. A follower would be unlikely to retaliate violently if the ranger mistreated it; instead, the follower would simply leave.
\par \~\~\tab The ranger's presence has a calming influence on wild animal followers which tempers their reactions to the ranger'
s other companions. The animal followers will generally leave other player characters alone, so long as the PCs keep their distance and don't antagonize them. However, if a PC comes too close to a lion, tiger, or other wild animal follower, the follower m
a
y respond with a warning snarl or even a swipe of the paw. If the PC doesn't get the message, the follower may attack. Such an attack continues until the PC withdraws or the ranger intervenes. If the ranger has trained the follower to attack only when ord
ered, fellow PCs won't have to worry about assaults. Otherwise, the ranger's companions are advised to keep their distance. Even a ranger will not approach a predatory follower just after it has made a kill.
\par \~\tab 
Naturally docile animals, such as sheep and mice, pose no threat to the party. Neither do domesticated creatures, such as farm animals and pets. Unless a trained animal is responding to its ranger's commands, the DM will decide how docile followers react,
 exactly as he does for followers that are wild animals.
\par \~\~\tab Wild animal followers respond to non-player characters in much the same way as they do the ranger's companions; that is, they ignore NPCs who keep their distance and make no hostile actions, but ma
y attack NPCs who get too close or threaten them. Docile animals respond timidly to unfamiliar NPCs, possibly cowering behind the ranger or seeking cover.
\par \~\~\tab A ranger's calming influence also extends to followers who would normally consider each other pred
ator and prey. If a deer and a lion are both among a ranger's followers, they co-exist harmoniously so long as they remain with the ranger. Though it's unlikely the pair would cuddle up together to go to sleep, neither would the lion eat the deer. At the 
s
ame time, the lion follower would consider all other deer fair game, hunting them as necessary to satisfy its hunger. Should the ranger abandon or dismiss his lion and deer followers, the animals would shortly revert to their natural states, and the deer 
might stand a good chance of becoming the lion's next meal.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Disadvantages
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab Animal followers provide many benefits to rangers, but there can be drawbacks as well. Here are a few typical complications, which the DM can use to add color to a campaign, serve as story springboards, or enliven an otherwise routine encounter.

\par {\pntext\pard\plain\f3 \loch\af3\dbch\af0\hich\f3 \'b7\tab}}\pard \fi-360\li720\nowidctlpar\tx0\tx360{\*\pn \pnlvlblt\ilvl0\ls1\pnrnot0\pnf3\pnindent360 {\pntxtb \'b7}}\ls1\adjustright {\fs24 
Some animals attract predators. A rat follower could attract a giant snake, or a boar follower might lure a hungry dragon. The ranger and his companions could be ambushed along with the followers.
\par {\pntext\pard\plain\f3 \loch\af3\dbch\af0\hich\f3 \'b7\tab}}\pard \fi-360\li720\nowidctlpar\tx0\tx360{\*\pn \pnlvlblt\ilvl0\ls1\pnrnot0\pnf3\pnindent360 {\pntxtb \'b7}}\ls1\adjustright {\fs24 
Certain followers may be sought by hunters and collectors. A weasel follower with lustrous ivory fur might prove irresistible to unprincipled sportsmen. A renegade wizard could target the party to get her hands on the feathers of a black owl
 follower, which she needs for a spell component. Rustlers might assault a party just to steal a ranger's horse follower.
\par {\pntext\pard\plain\f3 \loch\af3\dbch\af0\hich\f3 \'b7\tab}}\pard \fi-360\li720\nowidctlpar\tx0\tx360{\*\pn \pnlvlblt\ilvl0\ls1\pnrnot0\pnf3\pnindent360 {\pntxtb \'b7}}\ls1\adjustright {\fs24 
The presence of unusual followers may make NPCs less likely to deal with the party. A traveler may hesitate to share information wh
en a growling bear lurks in the background. A giant eagle fluttering overhead could discourage a merchant from trading with the PCs. The DM may modify an NPC's reaction by as much as -4 when disconcerting, threatening, or obnoxious animal followers are pr
esent.
\par {\pntext\pard\plain\f3 \loch\af3\dbch\af0\hich\f3 \'b7\tab}}\pard \fi-360\li720\nowidctlpar\tx0\tx360{\*\pn \pnlvlblt\ilvl0\ls1\pnrnot0\pnf3\pnindent360 {\pntxtb \'b7}}\ls1\adjustright {\fs24 
Some animals have habits which can make life uncomfortable, if not downright miserable, for the ranger and his companions. A filthy hyena follower might smell so bad that it makes the PCs' eyes burn. A parrot follower may insist on keeping the par
ty up all night with its incessant chatter. A curious squirrel follower could pick the pocket of a slumbering wizard, steal a crucial spell component, then bury it in the forest.

\par }{\b\fs28\cf13 Training Animal Followers
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab Rangers can train their animal followers to pe
rform a remarkable variety of tricks and tasks. Because of the ranger's unique rapport with his animal followers, he can teach them more efficiently than other characters are able to train normal animals. And because of the followers' eagerness to please,
 they learn their tricks and tasks more quickly.
\par \~\~\tab Two methods are provided for representing this special relationship with animal followers. The Standard method is the simplest and most straightforward, but treats all animals more or less the same. The Al
ternative method requires extra bookkeeping, but is a bit more realistic, as it takes into account the learning capacities of different species. Both methods are similar to and compatible with the animal training proficiency (the animal training proficien
cy itself isn't used to train followers). Whichever method you prefer, it's best to stick with it throughout the entire campaign.
\par \~\tab Before examining the training methods, let's clarify what is meant by tricks and tasks. These definitions apply to the animal training proficiency as well as the training methods described below.
\par \~\~\tab A }{\i\fs24 trick}{\fs24  is a specific action performed in response to a specific stimulus, such as a command, a sound, or a gesture. The action involves only a single step and requires no independen
t decision-making. In every instance, the animal performs the action exactly as taught, without improvisation of any kind. The stimulus must be unambiguous and precise ("stay"); any variance in the stimulus ("Don't move") is likely to be misinterpreted, r
esulting in a failure to perform the trick as intended.
\par \~\~\tab A }{\i\fs24 task}{\fs24  is general sequence of actions performed in response to a stimulus. The action may involve multiple steps and require some independent decision-making. Completion of the
 task may require a certain amount of improvisation. The stimulus may be non-specific (for instance, if taught the task of tracking, the follower is able to track a variety of animals, not just one particular species). Obviously, tasks are more difficult 
to master than tricks.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 The Standard Method
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab This training method uses essentially the same rules as the animal training proficiency described in Chapter 5 of the }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook}{\fs24 . The ranger announces the trick or task he wishes to teach a particular f
ollower (examples of tricks and tasks are given below). The DM may disallow the trick or task if he decides the follower is incapable of performing it; a reptile, for instance, may be too dull to come on command, or a chipmunk may lack the attention span 
needed to track. If the DM approves, the ranger proceeds. It takes the ranger 2d4 weeks to teach a trick to a follower and two months to teach a task.
\par \~\~\tab When the training period ends, the ranger makes a Wisdom check (using his own Wisdom score). If the che
ck succeeds, the animal has mastered the trick or task. If the check fails, the ranger can make another attempt to teach the follower the same trick or task by expending the same time and effort. He then makes another Wisdom check. If it succeeds, the ani
mal learns the trick or task. If it fails, then the animal cannot be trained to perform that trick or task. A follower can learn a maximum of 2d4 tasks or tricks, in any combination of the two.
\par \~\~\tab A ranger can train up to three followers at the same time. A
s all followers are naturally cooperative with the ranger, he doesn't need to prepare "wild" animal followers by taming them (unlike the requirement given in the animal training proficiency).
\par \~\~\tab Successful training assumes the ranger works with the followe
rs for short periods on a regular basis; the amount of time spent is less important than working with the follower every day. If the ranger fails to maintain a regular schedule--say, if he skips a full week or so of training--he must start over, investing
 another two months for a task or 2d4 weeks for a trick.
\par \~\~\tab The DM should write down the number of tricks and tasks a particular follower is able to learn. The player should also note the tricks and tasks on his ranger's record sheet as the followers learn 
them. Additionally, when teaching a follower a new trick or task, the player should keep track of how many weeks have passed for each training period.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 The Alternative Method
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab The Alternative method involves the use of a }{\i\fs24 trainability rating}{\fs24 , a general i
ndication of a follower's capacity to learn. The higher the trainability rating, the more tricks and tasks an animal can know and the faster it can master them. The trainability rating is primarily based on the animal's Intelligence score, but also takes 
i
nto account its fondness for humans and demihumans, its willingness to learn, and its eagerness to please. Trainability ratings apply only to a ranger's followers and have no bearing on the relationships between animals and other character classes or on t
he animal training proficiency.
\par \~\~\tab Tables 31-42 give trainability ratings for a variety of animal followers. The DM can use the trainability ratings in these tables as guidelines for assigning ratings to species not listed, should he decide to modify or expand the tables.
\par \~\~\tab The DM may also make exceptions for animal individuals. He may decide, for instance, that a particular squirrel is smart enough to merit a Medium rating rather than the Low rating given on Table 34. Likewise, he may rule that an exceptio
nally dull wolf deserves no better than a Low rating. In any case, the DM should make such a determination as soon as the follower arrives. A follower's trainability rating should not change once it has been assigned.
\par \~\~\tab The four ratings--Negligible, Low, 
Medium, and High--are discussed in detail below. Each describes the types of animals encompassed by the rating, the time required to learn tricks and tasks, and the maximum number of tricks and tasks that followers with the rating can learn. For convenien
ce, Table 44 summarizes this information.
\par \~\~\tab Additionally, each description lists several tricks and tasks associated with the rating. The lists don't include all possible tricks and tasks, but a general sample; the DM should use the lists as a basis to det
ermine the difficulty of any other trick or task that the ranger wishes to teach a follower. A follower can learn tricks and tasks associated with all lesser ratings, as well as those associated with its own rating; a Medium trainability follower, for ins
tance, can learn tricks and tasks associated with Negligible, Low, and Medium ratings.
\par \~\~\tab In all other respects, the Alternative method uses the same rules as the Standard method. Only the types and numbers of tricks and tasks, along with the training times, are different.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24 Negligible Trainability
\par }{\fs24 \~\~\tab This category includes animals with little aptitude for learning, such as fish, insects, arachnids, and reptiles. Most of these creatures have Intelligence scores of 0. Followers with negligible trainability can
 learn only the simplest tricks, such as those requiring movement towards or away from a stimulus. They can't learn tasks. Since some of these creatures are unable to discern sound, the ranger may need to use a bright light (such as a torch) or a broad ge
sture (a sweep of the hands) instead of a vocal command to get the follower to respond.
\par \~\~\tab A follower with negligible trainability can learn no more than a few (1d4) tricks, though the DM may decide that a particular animal is not capable of learning }{\i\fs24 any}{\fs24  tricks. Training time is 2d6 weeks per trick.
\par \~\~\tab Sample tricks:
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Withdraw.}{\fs24  The follower moves away from the ranger at maximum speed for 1-4 rounds, then stops.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Come.}{\fs24  The follower advances toward ranger at maximum speed, stopping when it comes within a few feet.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Stay.}{\fs24  The follower stays in place for 2-12 rounds, after which it resumes its normal activity.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Attack.}{\fs24  The follower aggressively attacks any creature indicated by the ranger. The attacks persist until the ranger breaks the command. Whether a
 follower fights to the death is up to the DM; in many cases, a follower in danger of losing its life (an animal that has lost half of its hit points) will withdraw. If the ranger commands such an animal to continue its attacks, a morale check may be in o
rder (see the Parting Company section below). Animals that have been attack-trained usually have a base morale of at least 11.
\par \~\~Attack-trained animals get a save vs. rods against another ranger's }{\i\fs24 animal empathy}{\fs24  ability.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24 Low Trainability
\par }{\fs24 \~\~\tab Animals in this
 category have an average but unexceptional aptitude for learning. They can learn a wide range of tricks, but few tasks. The category includes herd animals, small mammals, and birds, most of which have Intelligence scores of 1. The majority of animals eit
her belong to this category or the Medium trainability category.
\par \~\~\tab A follower with Low trainability can learn 2-8 (2d4) tricks and tasks, of which half or less can be tasks. Training time is 2-8 (2d4) weeks per trick and 10 weeks for tasks.
\par \~\~\tab Sample tricks:
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Heel.}{\fs24 
 The follower remains within a few feet of the ranger, mimicking his movement. The follower tries to move as fast as the ranger, stop when he stops, and stay with him until the ranger breaks the command. This type of movement is distinct from th
e follower's normal movement, as the follower remains at the ranger's side at all times, rather than lurking in back of the party. Mastery of the Come and Stay tricks usually precedes the learning of this trick.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Sit}{\fs24 . The follower sits on its haunches un
til the ranger breaks the command, at which time the follower resumes its normal actions. Variations include Standing, Rearing, Rolling Over, Playing Dead, and other simple physical feats, all of which are distinct tricks and require individual training p
eriods.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Speak.}{\fs24  The follower growls, barks, chirps, or makes any other natural sound on command.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Fetch.}{\fs24  The follower retrieves a specific object and brings it to the ranger. Typical objects include coins, balls, bones, or sticks. In order for the follo
wer to execute the command, the ranger must first show the object to the follower before throwing it or hiding it. The follower won't search indefinitely; if the ranger tosses the object in a field of high grass, for instance, the follower may search for 
1
0-30 minutes before giving up and returning to the ranger. Note that the Fetch trick doesn't allow the follower to hunt for and recognize objects belonging to a general category; that is, a follower can't enter a building and look for hidden gems or other
 treasure items.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Carry Rider.}{\fs24 
 This assumes the animal is physically able to carry a rider. It obeys simple movement commands from the rider, such as turning left and right, stopping, and trotting. However, the follower can't execute any of the maneuvers 
associated with the Stunt Riding task explained in the Medium trainability section below. This does not replace riding proficiency; any maneuvers performed by the rider, such as using the mount as a shield or leaping from the steed's back to the ground, r
equire the riding proficiency checks.
\par \~\~\tab Sample tasks:
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Retrieve.}{\fs24  The follower can locate and bring back a specific type of item from a general location. Such items might include coins, jewelry, weapons, or food; a general location might be the interior o
f a building, a grove of trees, or a shallow stream. The ranger must show the follower a sample similar to the desired item, and must also indicate the area which the follower is to search. The follower won't search indefinitely; if unable to find an item
, it usually will return empty-handed (or empty-mouthed) within an hour.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Bodyguard.}{\fs24  The follower protects the ranger or a designated friend from attacks by keeping opponents at bay or by attacking them directly, as commanded by the ranger. The follower w
ill fight alongside the ranger, making its own decisions which enemies to attack (it may, for instance, attack an unnoticed opponent sneaking up behind the ranger). The Attack trick must be learned before this task.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24 Medium Trainability
\par }{\fs24 \~\~\tab Exceptionally bright animals belong to this group, including those commonly found as pets, trained for circuses, or used in warfare. These animals will tend to have Intelligence scores in the 2-4 range.
\par \~\~\tab A follower with medium trainability is able to learn 4-10 (2d4+2) tricks or tasks in any combination. Training time is 2d3 (2-6) weeks for tricks, and 8 weeks for tasks.
\par \~\~\tab Sample tasks:
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Track.}{\fs24  The follower can follow the trail of an animal, human, or demihuman; in general, only followers capable of tracking prey by s
cent are eligible to learn this task. The follower must be familiar with the creature being tracked, or the ranger must provide a sample of the scent (a piece of clothing, a scrap of hide). It can retrace its path to lead the ranger to the creature. If th
e
 follower assists the ranger in tracking, the ranger adds +1 to his Tracking proficiency checks (see Chapter 2). If the follower is tracking by itself, it makes Tracking checks independently of the ranger. Assume that the base Tracking score of a wolf, li
on, or similar predator ranges from 13-16. A hunting dog's score may be as high as 19, while a young badger's score as low as 11; the DM makes the call.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Stunt Riding.}{\fs24  An animal follower with this proficiency can ride, performing all of the feats associated
 with the airborne and land-based riding proficiencies (as appropriate to the follower's size and species). For airborne mounts, animal's Stunt Riding score is the same as the ranger's Wisdom score, with a -2 penalty. For land-based mounts, the Stunt Ridi
n
g score is equal to the ranger's Wisdom score, with a +3 bonus. Therefore, a ranger with Wisdom 14 who wants his stunt-riding dog to balance on a horse leaping a gap wider than 12 feet must roll his Riding score of 17 or less (14 for his Wisdom, +3 for a 
land-based mount).
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24 High Trainability
\par }{\fs24 \~\~\tab Only a handful of followers, such as dolphins and certain primates, qualify for this category. Animals with high trainability can reason, weigh options, and arrive at their own conclusions. Their ability to learn tas
ks rivals that of some humans and demihumans. Their Intelligence scores begin at 5 and go up.
\par \~\~\tab A follower with high trainability can learn 6-12 (2d4+4) tricks or tasks, or any combination of the two. Training time is 1d4 weeks for tricks, and 6 weeks for tasks.
\par \~\~\tab Sample tasks:
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Lookout.}{\fs24  As directed by the ranger, the follower stands watch or scouts ahead, keeping alert for signs of trouble. If the follower perceives a threat, it unobtrusively alerts the ranger. This training includes a special signal t
he follower can give for the ranger's species enemy.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Complex Chore.}{\fs24  The follower can perform a complex chore requiring decision-making or a relatively detailed series of steps. Such chores include building a fire, washing dishes, or grooming a horse. Le
arning each chore requires a separate training period.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Weapon Use.}{\fs24  The follower wields a sword, dagger, or other simple weapon, using it when attacking. Each weapon requires its own training period, and opposable thumbs are needed in most instances. Thi
s task is most useful when the follower has already mastered the Attack trick or Bodyguard task, described above.

\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Success of Tricks and Tasks
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab Followers perform most tricks and simple tasks automatically; no die rolls 
or success checks are necessary. If the outcome of a particular task is uncertain (a follower taught to pull a wagon has a heavy load to haul) the DM may require an ability check if the relevant ability score is known (the follower pulls the wagon if a St
rength check succeeds), or he can assign a percentile chance based on his assessment of the situation (the load is exceedingly heavy; the DM sets the chance of success at 20%).
\par \~\~\tab The DM should adjudicate the Attack trick, the Bodyguard task, and similar combat-oriented tricks and tasks just as he would for normal combat situations, determining attack and damage rolls as required.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf13 Parting Company}{\b\fs24\cf13 
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab If a ranger treats his followers well, they'll remain with him indefinitely. If the ranger has not neglected the well-being of his followers, or violated their trust, loyalty checks for them are rarely necessary.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 When a Follower Abandons a Ranger}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \~\~\tab However, there is a limit as to how much abuse a follower will tolerate. The actions--or inaction--of the ranger
 may necessitate morale checks, as determined by the DM. Should a morale check succeed, the follower remains with the ranger. Should a check fail, the follower goes its own way, in most cases never to return. Followers who permanently abandon their ranger
 are considered lost and are not replaced.
\par \~\~\tab Here are some situations that may result in a follower abandoning its ranger. It's up to the DM to decide when a given situation becomes stressful enough for the follower to require a morale check.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Inhospitable Terrain.}{\fs24  An animal may hesitate to enter an environment radically different from its own. A hawk follower native to the mountains probably won'
t resist following a ranger into a forest or plain, but it may balk at entering an arctic region. Even if an a
nimal follows a ranger into hostile terrain, it may not remain there for long; for example, a hawk may tolerate the freezing climate of the arctic for no more than a day or two.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Reckless Endangerment.}{\fs24  Followers trained for combat willingly participate i
n encounters that may result in injury or even death. However, if the ranger forces an animal to participate in an unrelenting series of battles, resulting in serious damage or chronic fatigue, the follower may rebel and leave. Likewise, if a ranger regul
arly compels an animal to follow him into caverns, ruins, and similarly dangerous places, the animal may flee.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Starvation.}{\fs24  Though followers usually find their own food, in certain situations they may depend on their rangers for nourishment. If a ranger neglects to keep a follower fed, the follower may decide to look for greener pastures.

\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Mistreatment. }{\fs24 Most followers won't 
stand for beatings, whippings, or other physical mistreatment. (Being of noble character, most rangers won't administer such punishments, but exceptions do occur.) If the ranger persists in this behavior, abandonment is inevitable.
\par \~\tab }{\b\fs24 Inattention.}{\fs24  Some followers, particularly dogs and other domestic animals, have emotional as well as physical needs. A ranger who consistently ignores or withholds praise and affection from his followers risks losing them.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Mating Season.}{\fs24  An animal's urge to mate may overwhel
m its loyalty to its ranger. An animal may disappear during mating season and never return, particularly if it has trouble finding a suitable partner. Morale checks usually aren't applicable in these situations; instead, the DM may take advantage of matin
g season to restore balance to the game by eliminating a powerful follower, or getting rid of a cumbersome follower that's proving to be too much of a burden to a ranger.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Impending Death.}{\fs24  When certain followers reach the end of their days, due to illness
 or old age, they may abandon their ranger to die alone (an aged elephant journeying to an elephant's graveyard). Morale checks aren't usually necessary. Instead, the DM may engineer a poignant scene where the ranger realizes that death is near for his lo
yal companion, and must come to terms with the loss.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 When a Ranger Abandons a Follower
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab Situations may arise where the ranger wants to rid himself of a particular follower. A follower with negligible trainability may prove to be more annoying than helpf
ul. A filthy or frightening follower may make the party uncomfortable. A follower may eat too much, move too slowly, or scare off too many NPCs. Whatever the reason, the ranger has two options for abandoning a follower, either of which he can exercise any
 time he likes.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Release.}{\fs24 
 This is a form of temporary abandonment. Using commanding gestures and a firm voice, the ranger lets the follower know that he wants it to remain behind. Because of the special bond between the follower and the ranger, the follow
er instinctively understands what the ranger is telling it, and responds by reluctantly wandering away into the wilderness. Should the ranger return to the general area where he released the follower, and call out to the follower or otherwise make his pre
s
ence known, the released animal may show up again, ready to resume its role as a follower. (The DM decides if a released follower returns; generally, if the ranger attempts to locate the follower within a few months of its release, the animal will show up
 within a day or so. Otherwise, the ranger should assume that the released follower has died or relocated.)
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Dismiss.}{\fs24  This is a form of permanent abandonment. As wit
h release, the ranger communicates his desire to dismiss a follower through a series of gestures and vocal commands. The dismissed follower moves away into the wilderness, never to be seen again. A dismissed follower will not return to the ranger. A range
r can=t replace dismissed followers; they still count against his normal limit.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Other Options
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab A ranger who doesn't want to release or dismiss an unwanted animal follower has a host of other options, limited only by his imagination and the DM's approval
. He can arrange for a farmer, a zoo keeper, or other NPC to care for the follower (making sure, of course, the caretaker is of good alignment). He can keep it in his stronghold, asking a human or demihuman follower to care for it. He can also give it to 
a friendly NPC as a gift (again, presuming the NPC is of good alignment; failure to do so may be taken as a sign of betrayal by the ranger's remaining followers).
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf13 Humans and Demihumans}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \~\~\tab Humans and demihumans become followers for different reasons than a
nimals. Drawn to a ranger's reputation for honor and integrity, humans and demihumans serve as followers out of respect, admiration, and hero-worship. They remain loyal so long as their basic needs are met, and the ranger doesn't betray their trust.

\par \~\~\tab Trainability doesn't apply to human and demihuman followers. Instead, they will perform any duties or functions within reason. Typically, such followers serve as soldiers, but they may also work as guards, servants, or personal aides.
\par \~\~\tab Human and demihuman f
ollowers accompany the ranger as long as their basic needs are met and their are fairly treated. Some may serve with the understanding that the ranger will teach them the ways of the wilderness. It's up to the ranger to determine the needs and expectation
s of each new follower when he arrives.
\par \~\~\tab A ranger's human and demihuman followers aren't confined to a stronghold. They may accompany him on his travels or undertake independent missions. In other respects, a ranger's followers adhere to the guidelines given in Chapter 12 of the}{
\i\fs24  Player's Handbook}{\fs24 . The DM should prepare a character sheet with all relevant statistics for each new follower. The DM, not the player, controls the actions of the follower.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Restrictions.}{\fs24  In general, human and demihuman followers
 should be of 1st to 4th level when they appear; a 15th-level fighter has better things to do than tag along after a 10th-level ranger. Additionally, the follower should be of good alignment; except in rare cases, rangers won't tolerate neutral or evil fo
llowers.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Followers can be of either sex.}{\fs24  The age of the follower is also unimportant, although because of their low levels, most followers will be relatively young.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Personalities.}{\fs24  Impressionable youths, curious scholars, impulsive vagabonds, and orpha
ned wanderers all make good followers. Interesting quirks or personal problems make followers more fun for the players, and also provide springboards for adventures. Chapter 12 of the }{\i\fs24 DUNGEON MASTER Guide}{\fs24 
 offers suggestions for creating NPC personalities, which are also suitable for followers.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Abandonment.}{\fs24  Just as he may do with animal followers, the ranger may dismiss or release his human and demihuman followers. Released followers may rejoin the ranger at a later time. Human and demihuman rangers who a
re dismissed or otherwise lost can't be replaced.
\par \~\~\tab Human and demihuman followers may also abandon their rangers. Situations that may trigger abandonment include reckless endangerment, continual verbal abuse, or inattention to the follower's needs. If the
 ranger commits an act of cowardice or otherwise violates his code of honor, a follower may become disillusioned and abandon the ranger in disgust. The DM might make morale checks to determine if a follower stays or goes, he may resolve the situation by r
ole-playing (the follower requests an explanation for the ranger's cowardly behavior; the follower stays if the ranger offers a reasonable justification), or in extreme cases, he may have the follower simply disappear without explanation.

\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Notes on Falconry\~
\par }{\fs24 \tab 
\par \tab 
The principle of training hunting birds is that all food comes from the trainer, otherwise they are likely to fly off. They will be very dependent on the trainer; failure to feed them for 24 hours is pushing their limits. If more than 36 hours pass, t
he birds will likely die.
\par \~\~\tab Birds should be flown and exercised daily. Their health will deteriorate if they are not flown once at least every 3-4 days.
\par \~\~\tab Flying multiple birds at once is nearly impossible, as species dominance instincts take over; the h
igher status bird will let the lower status bird do the dirty work, then come in and steal the kill. Rarely, a species will hunt in family groups--one main hunter and several others to flush out the prey. A real-world example of this behavior is the Harri
s hawk.
\par \~\~\tab No falconer will fail to wear a heavy leather gauntlet on his catching arm (the "off" arm, usually the left). The gauntlet will not be metal, which is uncomfortable for the bird. It will cover the forearm, perhaps extending as far as the elbow. C
arrying birds like this is tiring, so a perch of some sort (as on a staff) is desirable.
\par \~\~\tab Hunting birds are never carried on the shoulder. Their natural instinct is to take out an eye or ear (which they can do with unbelievable speed) and their training 
reinforces the instinct. Even a well-trained bird cannot be trusted so close to the face.
\par \~\~\tab Owls can be flown as hunting birds. They are much harder to train than hawks or falcons (comparable to the independent feline versus the eager-to-please canine). U
nlike other birds, owls can be flown in the dark; however, their instinct is to strike stationary targets. They will not attack while a target is moving, but only when it pauses, stops, or hunkers down. Owls will kill hawks and falcons; the two types of b
irds cannot be flown together.

\par Chapter 4: Ranger Kits
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab Although they share similar abilities and philosophies, no two rangers are quite alike. But how do you make one different from another?
\par \~\~\tab This chapter offers a convenient solution in the form of }{\i\fs24 character kits}{\fs24 
. Character kits are structured collections of proficiencies, traits, benefits, and limitations that help define different rangers as unique individuals. A kit can serve as a basis for a ranger's personality, background, and role in a campaign.
\par \~\~\tab 
Character kits are entirely optional--ranger characters can get along without them just fine. But they're a lot of fun, adding color and depth to a campaign, as well as making rangers more interesting to play. We'll take a look at a number of kits in de
tail, and explain how to use them. We'll also give some tips on designing new kits from scratch.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf13 Acquiring Kits}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \~\~\tab Players choose character kits for their rangers as part of the character creation process. Only one kit can be chosen for a particular ranger.
\par \~\~\tab When creating a new ranger, begin by determining his ability scores (}{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook}{\fs24 , Chapter 1), race (}{\i\fs24 PH}{\fs24 , Chapter 2) and alignment (}{\i\fs24 PH}{\fs24 
, Chapter 4). At this point, select a character kit, recording the pertinent information on the character sheet
 (the record sheets at the end of this book are designed for character kits; permission is granted to copy these pages for personal use). In accordance with the kit information, flesh out the character by determining other relevant details, such as charac
ter proficiencies (}{\i\fs24 PH}{\fs24 , Chapter 5; and Chapter 5 of this book) and equipment (}{\i\fs24 PH}{\fs24 , Chapter 6; and Chapter 7 of this book).
\par \~\~\tab A player chooses a character kit at the outset of his ranger's career. It's possible, however, to incorporate the character kit rules
 into an existing campaign, providing the DM agrees that the kit is appropriate. A kit must be compatible with a ranger's personal history, his background, and his established personality traits. For example, the Mountain Man kit doesn't make sense for a 
ranger who's never been to the mountains. On the other hand, the Sea Ranger kit is a logical choice for a ranger who's spent most of his life at sea.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf13 DM Decisions
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab Before players create their characters, the DM should examine each of the kits and consider the following questions:
\par \~\~\tab Is this kit appropriate to the campaign? Not all kits fit with every campaign, and the DM is free to exclude any he feels are inappropriate. If the campaign takes place entirely on land, for instance, players may be barred fr
om choosing the Sea Ranger kit. Before the players create their characters, the DM should tell them which kits are allowed and which are forbidden.
\par \~\~\tab Do the players need additional information about any kit? Any campaign details relevant to a particular k
it should be explained to the players before they create their characters. For example, the DM may announce that an army of orcs have allied with a group of stone giants and declared war against all Giant Killers, or that the local king has levied a hefty
 tax on anyone charging for guide services, Pathfinders included.
\par \~\~\tab Are there changes in any kit? The parameters for each kit aren't engraved in stone, and the DM is free to make any changes he likes. He may decide that only female Guardians are allowed in
 his campaign world, or that all Justifiers must be members of a particular military order. All such changes should be made clear to the players before they create their characters.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf13 Kit Subsections
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab All character kits described in this chapter consist of the following elements:
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Description:}{\fs24  This section describes the features that distinguish a character associated with this kit, including his cultural background, duties, manner, and appearance.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Requirements:}{\fs24  Any special racial, ab
ility score, or alignment requirements are listed here. Characters can't take the kit if they don't meet the listed qualifications. "Standard" means that no special racial or ability requirements apply to this kit. A good alignment is assumed.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Primary Terrain:}{\fs24  Certain kits tend to be associated with specific environments. }{\i\fs24 Required}{\fs24 
 indicates that a character taking the kit must take the indicated primary terrain; if more than one type is listed, the player may choose whichever type he prefers. }{\i\fs24 Recommended}{\fs24 
 means that a character taking this kit is advised to use one of the listed primary terrain types, but isn't required to do so. }{\i\fs24 Any}{\fs24 
 means that there are no required or recommended types for this kit; the player may use any primary terrain he likes.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Role:}{\fs24 
 The character's role in society and in a campaign is detailed here. Typical motivations, personality, and beliefs are examined, along with common relationships with other people, reasons for joining an adventuring party, and usual function within a party
. Note that these traits don't necessarily apply to each and every character associated with this kit; players may shape the personalities of their characters based on these suggestions, or they may disregard them entirely and create personalities of thei
r own design.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Secondary Skills:}{\fs24  If you're using the rules for secondary skills from Chapter 5 of the }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook,}{\fs24  the character is restricted to the choice of skills listed in this section, or "no skill."
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Weapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24  If you're using th
e weapon proficiency rules, a kit may require the character to take specific weapon proficiencies or choose from a restricted list. Alternately, the character may have the option of choosing from a list of recommended weapons.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Nonweapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24  Although nonweapon proficiency rules are technically optional, they're strongly recommended when using ranger kits. However, if you're using secondary skills, you shouldn't use nonweapon proficiencies.

\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Bonus}{\fs24  proficiencies are received free of charge; they cost no proficiency slots. A }{\i\fs24 required}{\fs24  proficiency must be taken and does cost slots. }{\i\fs24 Recommended}{\fs24 
 proficiencies are skills typical for the kit. They cost the normal number of proficiency slots. It's a good idea for a beginning player to spend all or most of the ranger's initial slots on recommended proficiencies. }{\i\fs24 Barred}{\fs24 
 proficiencies cannot be taken initially, though they can be taken during play.
\par \~\~\tab An asterisk (*) indicates a new proficiency described in Chapter 5.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Armor/Equipment:}{\fs24  Some character types 
tend to use specific equipment, while others have limitations on the items available to them. Requirements and recommendations are given here, along with any style preferences associated with the kit. Unless indicated otherwise, a character must buy the r
equired equipment, including weapons, from his initial funds. Like all members of the warrior group, a ranger begins with 50-200 (5d4 *
 10) gp. If he lacks the funds to buy all of his required equipment, he should buy as much as he can, then pick up the rest as soon as he gets the money.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Species Enemy:}{\fs24  A particular species enemy may be required or recommended. If the enemy is }{\i\fs24 required}{\fs24 
, the character has no choice; he must take the indicated creature as a species enemy. If more than one creature is listed as a required enemy, the character can pick the one he prefers. }{\i\fs24 Recommended}{\fs24 
 enemies are only suggestions; the character may choose one if he likes, or ignore the recommendation. }{\i\fs24 Any}{\fs24  means that a ranger should choose his species enemy normally, as described in Chapter 2.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Followers:}{\fs24  As with the species enemy entry, this section may include either required or recommended followers. The DM should make sure that at least one of each }{\i\fs24 required}{\fs24 
 type shows up as a follower some time in the ranger's career (depending on there being enough slots available). }{\i\fs24 Recommended}{\fs24 
 followers show up at the DM's option. Any means that the character has no special follower restrictions or recommendations.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Special Benefits:}{\fs24  All kits give special benefits that aren't normally ava
ilable to other characters. Typical benefits include improved abilities, special relationships with followers, and reaction bonuses. All benefits are received free of charge, and don't count against the normal limitations of the ranger class.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Special Hindrances:}{\fs24 
 To balance their special benefits, kits also carry special hindrances. Hindrances may include reaction penalties, cultural restrictions, or ability limitations. All special hindrances are in addition to any disadvantages normally associated with 
the ranger class.

\par }{\fs24 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Beastmaster
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Description:}{\fs24 
 A wanderer, the Beastmaster has a natural affinity for animals; in fact, he has a limited form of telepathic communication with them. This is often the result of a magical bond with the Animal Kingdom, formed either at the time of his birth or upon reach
i
ng young adulthood. Unlike other adventurers, the Beastmaster does not command, train, or control his animal companions, rather they are his friends and comrades-in-arms. Misunderstood and feared by nobles and common folk alike for his unnatural abilities
 with animals, the Beastmaster seldom stays in one place for long, nor is he comfortable in civilized lands.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Requirements:}{\fs24  Standard.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Primary Terrain:}{\fs24  Any outdoor land.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Role: }{\fs24 Beastmasters tend to walk alone, accompanied only by the fierce natural be
asts that are their friends and allies. Traveling the fringes of settled lands, the Beastmaster has small use for the trappings of civilization, but even less for the minions of evil, particularly those of a magical or priestly nature. Thus, a Beastmaster
 will often find himself aiding the oppressed or enslaved, and pitted against the cruelties of evil priests or wizards and their allies.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Secondary Skills:}{\fs24  Hunter, Fisher.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Weapon Proficiencies: }{\fs24 A Beastmaster is initially limited to weapons that he can make himself: axe (any), club, dagger, dart, javelin, knife, quarterstaff, sling, or spear.
\par \~\tab \~}{\b\fs24 Nonweapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24  }{\i\fs24 Bonus:}{\fs24  None, but see Special Benefits.}{\i\fs24  Recommended:}{\fs24  Agriculture, Bowyer/Fletch
er, Endurance, Hunting, Leather working, Running, Swimming, Weather Sense. Optional: See Weaponsmithing (Crude) in the Mountain Man section).
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Barred:}{\fs24  Armorer, Etiquette, Heraldry, Navigation, Weaponsmithing.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Armor/Equipment:}{\fs24  The Beastmaster starts only with leather armor and weapons he has made.

\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Special Benefits:}{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Stealth:}{\fs24  The Beastmaster has a +5% chance to hide in natural surroundings.
\par \~\~}{\i\fs24 \tab Animal Henchmen:}{\fs24  Although a Beast
master receives no special followers at high level, he can acquire normal or giant animals as henchmen. He may acquire them at any level, and their number depends on his Charisma. If these animals are slain or driven away, they can be replaced by new anim
als without penalty (though this may take some time).
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Animal Telepathy:}{\fs24  The Beastmaster can establish telepathic communication with any normal or giant animal within 30', if he does nothing else in the round. The animal must have a minimum Intelligence o
f 1. This has the following benefits:
\par {\pntext\pard\plain\f3 \loch\af3\dbch\af0\hich\f3 \'b7\tab}}\pard \fi-360\li720\nowidctlpar\tx0\tx360{\*\pn \pnlvlblt\ilvl0\ls1\pnrnot0\pnf3\pnindent360 {\pntxtb \'b7}}\ls1\adjustright {\fs24 
The Beastmaster can communicate to the creature that he desires its friendship. If the offer is sincere (and the animal will be able to sense if it isn't), the creature can be calmed and will not attack or flee unless it is attacked.
\par {\pntext\pard\plain\f3 \loch\af3\dbch\af0\hich\f3 \'b7\tab}}\pard \fi-360\li720\nowidctlpar\tx0\tx360{\*\pn \pnlvlblt\ilvl0\ls1\pnrnot0\pnf3\pnindent360 {\pntxtb \'b7}}\ls1\adjustright {\fs24 
The Beastmaster can recruit an animal he has befriended as a henchman if he is not at his limit and if the creature fails a saving throw vs. rods. The saving throw is penalized by -1 for every three levels of experience the Beastmaste
r has earned. At the DM's option, animals may present themselves for recruitment in the same way that followers appear to other rangers.

limit, but this ability does not cross planar boundaries. This bond has the following effects:
\par {\pntext\pard\plain\f3 \loch\af3\dbch\af0\hich\f3 \'b7\tab}}\pard \fi-360\li720\nowidctlpar\tx0\tx360{\*\pn \pnlvlblt\ilvl0\ls1\pnrnot0\pnf3\pnindent360 {\pntxtb \'b7}}\ls1\adjustright {\fs24 
The Beastmaster can communicate directly with any animal henchman to which he has a bond. This gives him the ability to directly explain tricks or tasks he wi
shes the animal to attempt, or to communicate needs and desires. Conversely, the animal can also communicate its needs and desires to him.
\par {\pntext\pard\plain\f3 \loch\af3\dbch\af0\hich\f3 \'b7\tab}}\pard \fi-360\li720\nowidctlpar\tx0\tx360{\*\pn \pnlvlblt\ilvl0\ls1\pnrnot0\pnf3\pnindent360 {\pntxtb \'b7}}\ls1\adjustright {\fs24

 At 9th level, the Beastmaster can summon a horde of wild animals to fight for him. They must come from a land that he controls, and it takes one week to gather them.

 horde will stay together for one week for each level of the Beastmaster. There is no record of a Beastmaster summoning more than one horde in a year.
\par 
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Optional Rule:}{\fs24  The Beastmaster can split his experience award, giving up to half of his earned experie

\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Explorer
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Description:}{\fs24  The restless spirit of
 the Explorer makes him the most nomadic of all rangers. His travels take him around the world, as he continually seeks new lands to investigate and new cultures to study. No region is too remote, no society too primitive to pique the Explorer's interest.
 An expert in communication, survival, and anthropology, the Explorer's skills are invaluable for safely navigating uncharted terrain and negotiating with suspicious natives.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Requirements:}{\fs24  An Explorer must have a minimum Intelligence score of 12.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Primary Terrain:}{\fs24  Any (no specialization; use for followers and species enemy only).
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Role:}{\fs24  Motivated as much by curiosity as money, the Explorer spends more of his time planning expeditions than looking for employment. Still, Explorers are in high demand as 
guides, mapmakers, and scouts. A reputable Explorer can demand a high price for his services. However, rumors of a lost civilization are more likely to intrigue an Explorer than the promise of treasure, and he chooses his jobs accordingly.
\par \~\~\tab Though a Path
finder (discussed elsewhere in this chapter) or similarly skilled guide plays a crucial role in leading an expedition through unexplored territory, it's often an Explorer who's actually in charge. The Explorer decides when it's best to forge ahead and whe
n
 to rest. He knows that small parties travel better than large ones, as each additional member increases the likelihood of delays from injury and disease. Above all, he understands the relationship between safety and self-restraint. He discourages his com
panions from taking unnecessary risks whenever possible. 
\par \~\~\tab An Explorer balances his natural impulsiveness with healthy doses of caution and common sense. More of a scholar than a brawler, he is usually a reluctant combatant, resorting to violence only whe
n all other options fail. But when attacking, he fights with a single-mindedness that can border on savagery. A seasoned Explorer counsels his companions to follow two rules vital to wilderness survival, particularly where primitive civilizations are susp
ected to exist: (1) negotiating is usually preferable to attacking; and (2) if you intend to attack, then attack to kill.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Secondary Skills:}{\fs24  Fisher, Forester, Hunter, Navigator, Trader/Barterer, Trapper/Furrier.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Weapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24  Because an Explorer favors lightweight, easy-to-use weapons, his weapon proficiencies are confined to the following choices: short bow, light crossbow, dagger, dart, knife, sling, short sword.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Nonweapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24  }{\i\fs24 Special Bonus:}{\fs24 
 Survival; the Explorer receives the benefits of this proficiency in all terrain types. Assigning additional slots to this proficiency does not enhance its use in any way. }{\i\fs24 Required:}{\fs24  Cartography*, Reading/Writing. }{\i\fs24 Recommended:}{
\fs24  Ancient History, Bowyer/Fletch
er, Camouflage*, Direction Sense, Distance Sense*, Endurance, Fire-building, Fishing, Foraging*, Herbalism, Hunting, Languages (Ancient and Modern), Mountaineering, Navigation, Rope Use, Signaling*, Swimming, Trail Marking*, Trail Signs*, Weather Sense.

\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Armor/Equipment:}{\fs24  An Explorer has no special armor or equipment requirements. However, he rarely wears armor heavier than leather and most Explorers find shields awkward and confining.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Species Enemy:}{\fs24  Any.
\par \~\tab }{\b\fs24 Followers:}{\fs24  An Explorer has the normal 2d6 career limit (however, see Special Hindrances).
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Special Benefits:
\par }{\fs24 \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Languages:}{\fs24  An Explorer has the capability of learning twice the normal number of languages allowed by his Intelligence score (see Table 4 in Chapter 1 of the }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook}{\fs24 ). For instan
ce, an Explorer with an Intelligence score of 12 can learn six languages instead of the usual three. All languages still cost a proficiency slot each.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Find the Path:}{\fs24  The Explorer can use this ability to sense the correct direction that will eventually l
ead to a desired geographical locale, which must be in an outdoor setting. The Explorer must have some clue, map, information, or body of research about the locale in order to use this ability. It can be used once per week, providing a day's worth of guid
ance (hence it is of greatest use on an expedition of weeks or months duration).
\par   \tab }{\i\fs24 Culture Sense:}{\fs24  This ability allows the Explorer to acquire general knowledge about the laws and customs of a tribe, village, or settlement. Once per week, the Explorer may a
ttempt to use this ability by touching a member of the tribe or village. The villager must have the knowledge the Explorer wishes to gain; for instance, the villager can't be an infant or mentally deficient. Cooperation of the villager isn't required; tou
ching an attacking or sleeping villager works as well.
\par \~\~\tab The villager must make a saving throw vs. spells. If the throw succeeds, the Explorer learns nothing. If the throw fails, the Explorer acquires an instant understanding of the villager's laws and cus
toms, including those applicable to related clans or tribes (such as the social etiquette pertaining to all aarakocra in the region, not just this particular group). Information learned through this ability might include local laws (no one is allowed on t
h
e village streets after dark without written permission), accepted courtesies (strangers bow to all children), and cultural taboos (hats and other head coverings are considered offensive). Successful use of this ability also gives the Explorer a +1 reacti
on adjustment when encountering any other members of the tribe, village, or settlement.
\par \~\~\tab The DM may limit the quality and amount of information in any way he sees fit. The knowledge acquired through this ability doesn't ensure proper conduct; the Explorer
's behavior (and the player's decisions) will ultimately determine the reaction of all villagers.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Special Hindrances:
\par }{\fs24 \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Limited Animal Empathy:}{\fs24  Because he spends little time in one place, and much of his time is spent on native cultures and geographica
l studies, an Explorer does not develop animal empathy to the degree of other rangers. When dealing with wild or attack-trained animals, the animal's saving throw vs. rods has a +2 bonus. Further, the Explorer must make a successful Wisdom check when tryi
ng to calm or befriend domestic animals.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Few Followers:}{\fs24  The Explorer would travel lightly, unencumbered by followers that require his attention. Thus, he will have no more than two followers at the same time. If he already has two followers, a new follow
er won't arrive until one of his current followers is dismissed, lost, or killed.
\par \~\~ \tab }{\i\fs24 No Fortifications:}{\fs24  An Explorer has little interest in the responsibilities associated with property ownership. He will never build a castle or any other fortification.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Falconer
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Description:}{\fs24 
 The Falconer is an expert in the handling and training of falcons, birds of prey capable of learning an impressive range of tricks and tasks. Under the direction of a skilled Falconer, a falcon can be taught to snatch a coin purse
 from a victim's belt, bring down game birds in mid-flight, and fight effectively against creatures many times its size. In addition to his expertise as a bird trainer, the Falconer excels as a hunter and outdoorsman.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Requirements:}{\fs24  Standard.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Primary Terrain:}{\i\fs24  Required: }{\fs24 The Falconer must choose a primary terrain where falcons are most commonly found: Desert, Forest, Hill, Mountain, or Plains.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Role:}{\fs24  Many Falconers serve as retainers of kings or nobles. Others freelance as guides and mercenaries. Some 
stage public performances in rented halls or on street corners, demonstrating their birds' remarkable stunts for appreciative crowds. Regardless of how they make a living, Falconers are held in high regard by most people, who never fail to be impressed by
 the Falconer's amazing rapport with his birds.
\par \~\~\tab As falcons are extremely sensitive creatures, most Falconers by necessity must be even-tempered, patient, and self-assured. These traits also make the Falconer a valuable asset to an adventuring party. The 
Falconer's comrades will usually find him dependable and supportive, though perhaps a bit preoccupied with the needs of his bird. Sometimes falconers will have traits much like their birds--fierce, swift, and observant.
\par \~\~\tab In combat, the Falconer fights ag
gressively, he and his falcon generally conducting their attacks against the same opponent. If his falcon and a human companion are both threatened, the Falconer will often choose to defend his falcon. To prevent misunderstandings, an honorable Falconer w
ill make it clear where his loyalties lie before he joins an adventuring party.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Secondary Skills:}{\fs24  Bowyer/Fletcher, Forester, Groom, Hunter, Leather worker, Trader.
\par }{\b\fs24 \~\~\tab Weapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24  }{\i\fs24 Required:}{\fs24  A Falconer must take two of his initial weapon proficie
ncy slots in any of the following: bow (any), crossbow (light), dagger, knife, sling, spear. The remaining slots, as well as all subsequent slots, can be used for any weapon of the Falconer's choice.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Nonweapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24  }{\i\fs24 Bonus:}{\fs24  Falconry*.}{\i\fs24  Recommended:}{\fs24  Alertness*, Bowyer/Fletcher, Endurance, Hunting, Leatherworking, Veterinary Medicine*.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Armor/Equipment:}{\fs24  A Falconer has no special armor or equipment requirements. However, each falcon he trains requires a set of falconry training equipment (see Chapter 7).
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Species Enemy:}{\fs24  Any.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Followers:}{\fs24  Unlike other rangers, a Falconer receives an allotment of 3d6 followers, determined at 1st level. The falconer immediately receives a falcon follower at this time, which counts against his allotment. This falcon 
will be exceptionally strong and able. The DM may use the statistics in the Falconry proficiency description (see Chapter 5) for the initial falcon follower, as well as for any subsequent falcon followers.
\par \~\tab Until 10th level, a Falconer can only have one f
ollower, and that follower must be a falcon. If the falcon follower dies or is otherwise lost, a new falcon follower will arrive in accordance with the guidelines in Chapter 3. The new falcon counts against the 3d6 allotment.
\par \~\~\tab A Falconer becomes eligible
 to receive followers other than falcons when he reaches 10th level. At 10th level and beyond, the Falconer may have more than one falcon among his followers, depending on the circumstances of the campaign and decision of the DM.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Important Note:}{\fs24  Remember that a Falconer's follower will be a bird of rare and remarkable characteristics and loyalty. The Falconer can also train lesser birds for himself or others, using the standard training rules.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Special Benefits:
\par }{\fs24 \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Enhanced Training:}{\fs24  If a normal falcon has failed to learn a trick or task and become untrainable, the Falconer can try again after gaining a level.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Attuned Follower:}{\fs24  Under certain conditions, a Falconer is able to establish an exceptionally strong bond with a falcon follower. The bond enab
les the falcon to learn more efficiently, and enhances communication between the falcon and the Falconer.
\par \~\~\tab Whenever a Falconer acquires a new falcon follower, including the falcon he receives at 1st level, the falcon may be trained as a normal follower (
see Chapter 3). However, once the Falconer begins to train the falcon (using either the Standard or Alternate method), the falcon cannot become attuned.
\par \~\~\tab Otherwise, the Falconer can forego training until he attempts to become attuned to the new falcon. T
he attuning attempt takes six weeks. For at least an hour each day, the Falconer talks to the bird, strokes its feathers, and engages in other nurturing behavior. The bird learns to respond to the Falconer's voice, though the Falconer refrains from teachi
ng it any specific tricks or tasks during this time. (In combat encounters which take place in this period, the falcon will fly to safety at the first sign of trouble, then return to the Falconer's shoulder when all's clear).
\par \~\~\tab At the end of the six-week p
eriod, the Falconer makes a Wisdom check. If the check fails, the attuning attempt has likewise failed. The falcon continues its relationship with the Falconer as a normal follower. The Falconer may begin to train the falcon according to either the Standa
rd or Alternate method described in Chapter 3. The Falconer can't make a second attempt to attune the falcon.
\par \~\~\tab If the check succeeds, the falcon is attuned. Normally, the Falconer can teach the attuned falcon a task or trick each time he gains a level, at
 the same time he undergoes his own level training. The Falconer may also use the normal training rule, either the Standard or Alternative method. Training time is half that given in the falconry proficiency (see Chapter 5). Regardless how it is trained, 
an attuned falcon can learn tricks or tasks in any combination, up to one per level of the falconer. An attuned falcon never becomes untrainable. 
\par \~\~\tab Additionally, once a falcon becomes attuned, it receives a one-time hit point bonus equal to twice the Falc
oner's level. For example, if a falcon becomes attuned to a 3rd level Falconer, the falcon receives a bonus of 6 hit points. This bonus remains the same, even if the Falconer later advances in level.
\par \~\~\tab The following benefits apply only to a Falconer and an attuned falcon.
\par \~\~}{\i\fs24 \tab Fearless Falcon:}{\fs24  When fighting on behalf of a Falconer or under a Falconer's direction, an attuned falcon never needs to make a morale check.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Falcon Species Enemy:}{\fs24  An attuned falcon has its own species enemy. When a falcon follower 
becomes attuned, determine its species enemy, either by rolling on the appropriate table in Chapter 2 (Tables 20-27), or by the DM choosing a particular enemy. The falcon and ranger may share the same species enemy. The falcon has all of the species enemy
 bonuses and penalties described in Chapter 2.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Attack Bonus:}{\fs24  An attuned falcon receives a +2 bonus to all attack rolls, except when fighting its species enemy (when it receives a +4 bonus).
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Speak With Falcon: }{\fs24 
A Falconer who reaches 10th level acquires the ability to speak with an attuned falcon follower. The ability is similar to the 2nd level priest spell speak with animals, except it requires no components or casting time, and the Falconer can do so at will.

\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Mental Communication:}{\fs24 
 At 15th level, the Falconer can communicate mentally with an attuned falcon follower. Both the Falconer and attuned falcon can send and receive thoughts at will, up to a distance of 100 yards per level of the Falconer. Walls or oth
er physical boundaries have no effect on this ability.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Special Hindrances:}{\fs24  If an attuned falcon dies, or is lost for any other reason, the Falconer succumbs to grief and despair for 1-4 weeks. During this period of mourning, the Falconer makes all attac
k rolls and ability checks at a -2 penalty. Additionally, during this period, no new followers can be acquired, nor can the Falconer use the }{\i\fs24 animal empathy}{\fs24  ability.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Feralan
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Description:}{\fs24  What happens to children who wander into the wilderness and are n
ever recovered? Or worse, children who are abandoned by their families, left in the woods to fend for themselves? Sadly, most of them eventually succumb to the dangers of the wild. But a fortunate few are taken in by animals, raised as part of a lion's br
ood or a wolf's litter. Cut off from civilization, they gradually take on the characteristics of the creatures who adopted them. In the process, they become Feralans, beings who combine the savagery of a beast with the intellect of a man.
\par \~\~\tab The Feralan may
 look like a human, but for the most part, he acts like a wild animal. He speaks the language of animals and lives in their lairs. He leads them on hunts, defends them against predators, and considers them his family. Yet, the Feralan retains vestiges of 
his own race, characterized by his agile mind and an unshakable curiosity about human civilization. Many Feralans have picked up enough human language to communicate with them, albeit on a limited basis.
\par \~\~\tab Despite his bestial tendencies, the Feralan's mora
l principles are not so different from other rangers. He values the well-being of his followers as much as his own. He avoids needless killing and considers himself the nemesis of hunters who stalk game for sport. Greed and jealously are as unknown to the
 Feralan as they are to the creatures of the forest.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Familial Species:}{\fs24  At the beginning of his career, the player should choose a familial species for his Feralan, representing the type of animal that raised him. A Feralan can have only a single familial
 species, which never changes. The familial species must share the Feralan's primary terrain and is subject to the DM's approval. Animals suitable as familial species include wild dogs, bears (any), wolves, great cats (any), and primates (any). The DM may
 augment this list with additional choices if he likes; familial species can't be human, demihuman, humanoid, or of magical or supernatural origin.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Requirements:}{\fs24  Feralans must have a minimum Constitution of 15 and a minimum Strength of 14. They cannot be of lawful alignment.
\par \~\~\tab Though some humans and demihumans raised by wild animals have neutral or evil outlooks, only those with good alignments qualify as Feralans. Because Feralans have little use for the laws and regulations of the civilized world, most
 are chaotic good.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Primary Terrain: }{\fs24 The vast majority of Feralans have Forest or Jungle as their primary terrain. Arctic, Hill, Mountain, Plains, and Swamp are possible but less common.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Role:}{\fs24  Many people fear Feralans, wrongly considering them to be 
ferocious wildmen or savage werecreatures. Those who befriend Feralans, however, come to know them as trustworthy, noble, and even gentle. Still, Feralans remain wary of most humans and demihumans, finding their actions unpredictable and often incomprehen
sible.
\par \~\~\tab Feralans rarely volunteer to join adventuring parties. However, because Feralans are fervent animal advocates and protectors of the wild, they are inclined to cooperate with parties who share their concerns.
\par \~\~\tab While a Feralan's human companions m
ay admire his courage and respect his instincts, they may find his beast-like behavior offensive at best, frightening at worst. After a hunt, a Feralan may drag the carcass of his prey back to the party's campsite and eat it raw, tearing off chunks with h
i
s familial followers. Personal hygiene is rarely among a Feralan's priorities, though he may occasionally lick himself clean. He grooms his animal friends by picking bugs from their fur, then cuddles up with them to go to sleep. When disturbed, he may sna
rl like a wolf. To celebrate victory over a predator, he may howl at the moon. He communicates in grunts, growls, and sentence fragments. He may disconcert new associates by sniffing them.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Secondary Skills}{\fs24 
: Fisher, Forester, Hunter, Trapper/Furrier. The secondary skills reflect talents that Feralans have picked up in the wild; therefore, all skills have wilderness applications only. A Fisher Feralan, for instance, may know how to swim and catch fish, but w
on't be able to operate a boat.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Weapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24  }{\i\fs24 Required:}{\fs24  club, knife. A Feralan's remaining slots must be spent on primitive weapons: blowgun (rare), dagger, short bow, dart, hand axe, sling, spear.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Nonweapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24  }{\i\fs24 Bonus: }{\fs24 Hunting or Fi
shing; Trail Signs*. His remaining initial proficiencies must be chosen from these: Alertness*, Animal Handling, Animal Lore, Blind-fighting, Direction Sense, Endurance, Fire-building, Fishing, Foraging, Hunting, Rope Use, Running, Set Snares, Survival, S
wimming, Veterinary Healing*, Weather Sense.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Armor/Equipment:}{\fs24  Feralans adorn themselves in crude smocks or loincloths made of furs and hides. They wear only what is necessary to keep themselves warm and comfortable.
\par \~\~\tab A Feralan wears no armor, nor does 
he carry a shield. His main weapons--the ones associated with his weapon proficiencies--he makes himself from bones, branches, rocks, and other natural materials. If he loses or breaks one of these weapons, he can come up with a replacement in few hours, 
assuming suitable materials are available. He can use weapons other than those he makes, but prefers not to.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Species Enemy: }{\fs24 Any.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Followers:}{\fs24  Unlike other rangers, the Feralan begins to receive followers at 5th level. At least half (rounded up) of his f
ollowers will be of his familial species. A Feralan will receive at most one human, demihuman, or humanoid as a follower, and this only at 10th level or higher.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Special Benefits:}{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Stealth:}{\fs24  The Feralan receives a +10% chance to hide in natural surroundings and a +10% chance to move silently.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Feral Rage:}{\fs24  During melee combat, the initial wounding of an opponent may impel the Feralan into a frenzy of blood lust, increasing his fighting effectiveness. A Feralan can make one attempt to become enraged at a
ny particular opponent. After the first round in which a Feralan inflicts damage on an opponent, the Feralan has the option of making a saving throw vs. death magic. If the roll succeeds, the Feralan goes into a feral rage for the next 2d6 rounds. During 
t
hat time, the rage gives the Feralan a +2 bonus to all attack and damage rolls, and his base Armor Class improves by 2 (an unarmored Feralan's AC is temporarily raised to 8). However, all attacks must be made against the designated opponent and the Ferala
n must attack in every round he's able; he can't voluntarily break off an attack, or choose to attack a different opponent.
\par \~\~\tab An enraged Feralan must continue to attack the designated opponent until the feral rage wears off, or the opponent dies or escapes
. If the rage wears off, the Feralan may continue to attack normally, or take any other action; however, the Feralan can't attempt to become enraged again against the same opponent. If the opponent dies, the feral rage automatically ends. If the opponent 
flees, the Feralan will pursue for the duration of the rage.
\par \~\tab }{\i\fs24 Climbing:}{\b\fs24  }{\fs24 The Feralan has a base climbing success rate of 60%. This allows tree climbing at the Feralan's normal movement rate (cliff clim
bing instead if the primary terrain is Arctic, Desert, or Mountain). This ability is much more limited than the thief ability to climb walls. The climbing modifiers discussed in Chapter 14 of the }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook}{\fs24 
 apply in all situations other than those given.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Speak with Animals:}{\fs24  The Feralan can use this ability at will with animals from his familial species. The ability is similar to the 2nd level priest spell speak with animals, but requires no components or casting time.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Familial Rapport:}{\fs24  The fami
lial followers of a Feralan will generally do what they're asked, assuming they're physically capable of doing so, when the Feralan speaks to them in their own language. Mistreated familial followers may still abandon a Feralan, as detailed in the Parting
 Company section of Chapter 3.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Animal Training:}{\fs24  The Feralan may train non-familial followers (use guidelines in Chapter 3).
\par   \tab }{\i\fs24 Call of the Wild:}{\fs24  When in his primary terrain, the Feralan may attempt to summon familial species animals by howling at the top
 of his lungs for 1-6 rounds. The DM then secretly rolls percentile dice. If the result is less than or equal to the Feralan's Wisdom score plus his level (a 5th level Feralan with Wisdom 15 has a base chance of 20%), 1-4 familial animals show up within t
he next hour. Once they arrive, these animals act as followers for the next 1-4 hours. During this time, the Feralan may command them with his }{\i\fs24 speak with animals}{\fs24 
 ability. At the end of the 1-4 hour period, the summoned animals disappear into the wilderness. A Feralan can attempt }{\i\fs24 call of the wild}{\fs24  once per day.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Special Hindrances:
\par }{\fs24 \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Limited Magic:}{\fs24  Because of his mental predisposition and animalistic tendencies, a Feralan can only learn and cast a limited number of spells. He has access only to spells of th
e animal sphere and can't cast spells any higher than 2nd level. Table 41 shows the Feralan's spell progression.

\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Limited Money:}{\fs24  A Feralan has little interest in money or gems, which for the most part are as worthless to him as rocks. He keeps only enough 
funds to cover training costs, equipment replacement, and basic living expenses. He usually allows fellow party members to divide the remainder of his share of treasure as they wish. (However, the Feralan still receives all experience points due him for f
inding treasure and fellow party members receive no experience point benefit for the Feralan's share.)

\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Forest Runner
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Description: }{\fs24 Wherever a corrupt or oppressive regime holds power, there's bound to be a Forest Runner. Forest Runners rise in opposition to such regimes, living on th
e fringes of society, usually one step ahead of the law. They're criminals only in a technical sense, as they adhere to a personal code that compels them to wage war against greedy aristocrats and unjust rulers. While the powers-that-be view the Forest Ru
nner as a lawless troublemaker, commoners see him as hero, perhaps their best hope against a tyrannical government.
\par \~\~\tab Constantly on the move, Forest Runners live by their wits and have learned to make do with minimal resources. They excel in combat and mak
e formidable opponents. Ever active and brimming with self-confidence, Forest Runners delight in harassing authority figures, particularly the pompous and well-to-do. Many a hapless aristocrat has been left bound, gagged, and penniless after a humiliating
 roadside encounter with a Forest Runner.
\par \~\~\tab Any time after reaching 4th level, the Forest Runner will acquire a }{\i\fs24 personal nemesis}{\fs24 . This is an NPC of near equal level whose campaign goal is to capture or kill the Forest Runner.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Requirements:}{\fs24  A Forest Runner must have a Charisma score of at least 12.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Primary Terrain:}{\fs24  Most Forest Runners hail from civilized regions in Forest, Hill, Plains, Mountain, or Jungle. However, no terrain type is excluded, providing it contains a reasonably sized and sufficiently 
corrupt settlement. (A Forest Runner from a primary terrain other than Forest, modifies the name accordingly, such as Mountain Runner, Swamp Runner, and so on.)
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Role:}{\fs24  The Forest Runner is usually selfless, resourceful, and roguishly charming. A loner by
 circumstance and not by choice, a Forest Runner readily allies with adventuring parties who share his outlook. As a champion of underdogs everywhere, the Forest Runner doesn't necessarily feel bound to his homeland, and may journey anywhere in the world 
to promote justice. Occasionally, he may join a party to acquire treasure for distribution to the needy. If the local authorities are putting the heat on, he may accompany a party simply to disappear for a while.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Secondary Skills:}{\fs24  Bowyer/Fletcher, Forester, Farmer, Hunter, Leather worker, Teamster, Weaponsmith.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Weapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24  The Forest Runner receives a bonus weapon proficiency slot, above and beyond those he's normally allowed. The bonus slot must be filled with one of the following weapons: l
ong bow, quarterstaff, long sword, or dagger. He must then fill three of his first six slots with the remaining weapons on this list. Once he's met this requirement, he may fill subsequent slots with any weapons of his choice.

\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Species Enemy:}{\fs24  A Forest Runner's species enemy sh
ould have some association with the corrupt regime he opposes. It may be the king's pet (such as a wolf or tiger), an evil race with which the monarchy has aligned itself (goblins or ogres), a symbol of the government (a snake or a hydra) or a creature th
e opposed officials have used in war (a dragon or a giant).

\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Special Benefits:
\par }{\fs24 \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Stealth:}{\fs24  The Forest Runner has a +5% chance to hide in natural surroundings and a +5% chance to move silently.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Inspire:}{\fs24  Once per day, prior to making a
n attack, a Forest Runner may spend 2-5 (1d4+1) rounds boosting the morale of his companions with flattering words and expressions of confidence. He can influence a number of companions equal to his level. If the Forest Runner makes a successful Charisma 
c
heck afterwards, the companions enjoy a +2 bonus to their morale for the next 3-12 (3d4) rounds. Each companion also receives a +1 bonus to his first attack roll. The inspiring speech doesn't affect animals, other Forest Runners, or himself. The Forest Ru
nner can't attempt to inspire his companions in the midst of battle or while they're occupied in any other activity.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Disguise:}{\fs24  The Forest Runner can take the Disguise proficiency for one proficiency slot.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Reaction Bonus:}{\fs24  In his homeland or any region w

ultures.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Special Hindrances:}{\fs24 
 Forest Runners will rarely develop a close relationship with any NPC with political power. Additionally, a Forest Runner runs a constant risk of arrest by authorities of his homeland, as well as from other regimes with which 
his homeland has extradition agreements. Law-enforcement authorities may plague a Forest Runner through his entire career.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Giant Killer
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\tab }{\b\fs24 Description: }{\fs24 The Giant Killer is a skilled combatant, often from humble beginnings, trained to the specific purpose 
of slaying giants. He has mastered combat techniques designed to fell giants, and has become an expert in their behavior and habits. A Giant Killer is nothing if not confident; a giant's immense size merely means he makes a good target.
\par \~\~\tab For the purposes
 of this kit, giants include true giants, such as: cloud giants, fire giants, frost giants, hill giants, stone giants, and storm giants. Also included are giant-kin, such as cyclops, ettins, firbolg, fomorians, verbeeg, and voadkyn. The DM may augment thi
s list with other giants relevant to his particular campaign.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Requirements:}{\fs24  A Giant Killer must have a minimum score of 15 in both Strength and Dexterity.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Primary Terrain:}{\fs24  Any terrain is acceptable, so long as some type of giant calls it home.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Role:}{\fs24 
 Giant Killers have keen minds, strong bodies, and unshakable egos. Most Giant Killers tirelessly promote their own skills and accomplishments, boasting of their latest triumphs to anyone who'll listen. Not surprisingly, their reputations precede them
 in most civilized regions. However, reactions among residents vary. For every person who reveres the Giant Killer as a hero, there's another who dismisses him as a blowhard. But when giants plague a community, everyone welcomes a Giant Killer with open a
rms.
\par \~\~\tab 
Even when their services are desperately needed, Giant Killers rarely exploit their position. Most charge only modest fees, or settle for a medal or other token of appreciation in lieu of payment. As often as not, Giant Killers seek no remuneration 
of any kind, fighting giants for the sheer pleasure of it.
\par \~\~\tab Unsurprisingly, the mere promise of an encounter with a giant is reason enough for most Giant Killers to join an adventuring party. For the most part, a Giant Killer leaves decision-making to ot
hers. Though in principle, he may share the party's fervor for the expedition at hand, he's usually more concerned with finding giants. He may become impatient and surly if the party goes for too long without meeting one.
\par \~\tab The Giant Killer relishes violent encounters of all kinds, if only to exercise his combat skills. Of course, he comes into his own when fighting giants, and it's a wise party that follows his lead in such situations.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Secondary Skills: }{\fs24 Bowyer/Fletcher, Forester, Groom, Hunter, Tailor, Weaponsmith.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Weapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24 
 Because the Giant Killer faces tall adversaries, he must become proficient with missiles and hurled weapons. The first weapon slot, and every odd slot (third, fifth, and so on), must be a missile weapon: bow (any), cro
ssbow (any), sling, staff sling, or any melee weapon that can be hurled. The even-numbered slots may be filled with any weapons of the Giant Killer's choice.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Nonweapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24  Giant Killers pursue their interest in giants with such single-mindedn
ess that they have little time left to master other skills. Therefore, a Giant Killer is allowed only one nonweapon proficiency at first level. This must be selected from the following: Bowyer/Fletcher, Cobbler, Cooking, Hunting, Pottery, Riding (Land-bas
ed), Running, Tailor, Swimming, Weaving.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Armor/Equipment:}{\fs24  Giant Killers have no special equipment requirements. They often carry shields decorated with medals and ribbons awarded them from grateful communities for slaying troublesome giants. Though such 
shields can be used normally, they're mainly for show; Giant Killers generally put them aside before engaging a giant in battle.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Species Enemy:}{\fs24  None; however, see Special Bonuses against giants.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Followers:}{\fs24  Normal (but see optional rule).
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Special Benefits:

Giant Killers inflict bonus damage against giants, +1 point of damage for every level of the Giant Killer. }{\fs24 For example, if a 7th level Giant Killer makes a s

If a giant with initiative attacks and hits, the Giant Killer may give up his action to dodge. If the Giant Killer saves vs. death magic, the giant's attack misses. If the Giant Killer has initiative, he can dodge instead of attacking for the round.

\par }\pard \nowidctlpar\tx0\tx360{\*\pn \pnlvlcont\ilvl0\ls0\pnrnot0\pndec }\adjustright {\fs24 \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Infuriate:}{\fs24 
 A Giant Killer can goad a giant into making careless and ill-conceived attacks. To infuriate a giant, the Giant Killer spends two rounds darting between the giant's legs, waving his hands, and hollering ins
ults. The Giant Killer cannot make attacks or take any other actions while attempting to infuriate the giant; if interrupted (to dodge, for example), he must start over. During this time, the giant can attack the Giant Killer; however, because of the Gian
t Killer's erratic movement, the giant's attacks are made at an additional -2 penalty.
\par \~\~\tab At the end of this period, the giant makes a saving throw vs. spells. If the throw succeeds, nothing special happens. If the throw fails, the giant becomes enraged for
 the next 2-12 (2d6) rounds. During that time, the giant directs all of his attacks against the Giant Killer; the giant's attacks are made at an additional -4 penalty. The Giant Killer may attack normally while the giant is infuriated.
\par 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Optional Rule:}{\fs24  Follower Infuriation
\par \~\~\tab A Giant Killer may enhance his chances of infuriating a giant by using an animal follower that has been trained to infuriate. The follower, which must be a bird or other flying creature of small size (S), learns this trick in accordanc
e to the Training Followers rules in Chapter 3. The trick counts against the follower's normal limit of tricks and tasks. Only a Giant Killer can train a follower to infuriate.
\par \~\~\tab While the Giant Killer is executing his infuriating routine, the follower ma
y also infuriate the giant by swooping around his head and screeching. The giant's saving throw against the infuriation is reduced by a -2 penalty for the infuriating follower. This effect is not cumulative with additional followers. An infuriated giant m
i
ght direct its attacks at the infuriating follower in addition to the Giant Killer. If the giant tries to attack an infuriating follower, the follower successfully dodges the blow unless the attack roll is a 19 or 20. A follower can't attempt to infuriate
 alone. A follower can only augment the infuriating attempts of the Giant Killer.
\par \tab }{\i\fs24 Giant Lore:}{\fs24  If a Giant Killer discovers a footprint, lair, campsite, or any other physical evidence of a giant, a successful Wisdom roll enables him to learn some general inf
ormation about the giant in question. Such information may include the giant's type, approximate size, and companions. He may also learn how recently the giant was in the area and in what direction the giant traveled. The DM decides the quality and amount
 of information the Giant Killer receives.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Special Hindrances:
\par }{\fs24 \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Tracking Limitation: }{\fs24 Unlike other rangers, the tracking ability of the Giant Killer is limited to tracking giants. A Giant Killer who selects a general Tracking proficiency can track other
 creatures as non-ranger character.
\par \~\~\tab Because Giant Killers seldom make an effort to conceal their identities, they're often singled out for harassment. Insecure villagers may challenge Giant Killers to duels to impress their friends, or bullies may ambus
h Giant Killers to demonstrate their toughness.
\par \~\~\tab To avenge the death of a companion, some giants may target Giant Killers for assassination. Giant tribes occasionally offer bounties for proof of a Giant Killer's death, making the Giant Killer a prime candidate for attacks.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Greenwood Ranger
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Description:}{\fs24  The rarest and certainly the most unusual ranger, the Greenwood Ranger, or Limbant, combines characteristics of both humans and plants. The Greenwood Ranger beg
ins life as a normal human, but through resolute appeals to the gods, he gradually acquires plant-like qualities that enhance his relationship with the vegetable kingdom and endow him with remarkable powers.
\par \~\~\tab A Greenwood Ranger resembles a normal human c
overed from head to toe with a layer of thick brown bark, similar to that of an oak tree. The bark on the back of his head and the backs of his hands and arms is tinged with green; the green bark enables him to absorb nutrients directly from the sunlight 
(see the Special Benefits section below). He has no body hair, no teeth, and his tapering fingers and toes look like gnarled branches. Tangles of short roots grow from his feet and ankles.
\par \~\~\tab Aside from these physical differences, the Greenwood Ranger moves, speaks, and behaves much like an ordinary human. As his human qualities are dominant, he has a +2 bonus when saving against}{\i\fs24  hold plant, charm plant}{\fs24 
, and similar plant-related spells. Otherwise, the Greenwood Ranger makes saving throws, attack rolls, and ability checks as a normal human ranger.
\par \~\tab }{\i\fs24 Becoming a Greenwood Ranger:}{\fs24  A ranger must make the commitment to become a Greenwood Ranger at 1st level, even though the Greenwood Ranger's special abilities are not acquired until 4th level. From 1st through 3rd
 level, he is considered to be a latent Greenwood Ranger. A latent Greenwood Ranger operates as the standard ranger described in the }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook}{\fs24 
, though following the Secondary Skill, Weapon Proficiency, and Nonweapon Proficiency restrictions describ
ed below (and receiving the indicated Bonus Proficiencies). He may wear any armor allowed a normal ranger. He does not have any of the Greenwood Ranger's special benefits or hindrances at this time.
\par \~\~\tab During this latency period, the ranger must spend a mi
nimum of three hours per week in silent prayer, petitioning the gods to transform him into a Greenwood Ranger. It isn't necessary for the player to keep track of the hours spent in prayer; presumably, the character will set aside enough spare time to meet
 
this requirement. The gods may tolerate an occasional lapse--for instance, the ranger may be too sick to pray in a particular week--but the ranger is otherwise expected to keep up with his prayers. If the ranger intentionally neglects his prayers on a reg
ular basis (as determined by the DM), the gods will inform the ranger in a dream that he's no longer eligible to become a Greenwood Ranger. The ranger is forced to abandon the kit, and may }{\i\fs24 not }{\fs24 take another.
\par \~\~\tab When the latent Greenwood Ranger reaches 4th le
vel, the gods give him a simple task to complete, involving the protection or support of plant life. Typical tasks include assisting a treant, replanting an area of forest devastated by fire, and teaching a primitive tribe how to grow and harvest their ow
n crops. A latent Greenwood Ranger who fails to complete this task within a month must spend an additional 1-4 months praying, at which time the gods will grant a new task.
\par \~\~\tab A latent Greenwood Ranger who completes the task then locates an isolated area of
 forest or jungle, lies on the ground, and covers himself with leaves and branches. He then falls asleep for a full day. If disturbed before 24 hours elapse, the transformation is interrupted; the ranger may try again at another time. Otherwise, upon awak
ing, the ranger will have transformed into a Greenwood Ranger. Once transformed, the Greenwood Ranger }{\i\fs24 cannot}{\fs24 
 abandon this kit, although actions that would normally cost a ranger his class result in the loss of spell use and other penalties determined by the DM.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Requirements:}{\fs24  A Greenwood Ranger must be human. Otherwise, the ability requirements are the same as those for a normal ranger.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Primary Terrain:}{\i\fs24  Required:}{\fs24  Forest or Jungle.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Role:}{\fs24  Because he must sacrifice a portion of his humanity to become a 
Greenwood Ranger, a human drawn to this kit usually has only a tenuous link with formal society. He is an outsider, with few close friendships or family ties, capable of walking away from the civilized world without regret. Orphans, social outcasts, and e
ccentric personalities are good candidates to become Greenwood Rangers.
\par \~\~\tab Greenwood Rangers live deep in the forest or jungle, far from urban centers. Most people tend to shun Greenwood Rangers, repulsed by their appearance or fearful of their strange powe
rs. But their distrust is unwarranted. Greenwood Rangers are gentle-natured, thoughtful souls to whom all life is precious. A Greenwood Ranger will mourn the loss of a favorite shade tree as much as the passing of a human companion. To the Greenwood Range
r, the wilderness is a glorious, sacred place. If necessary, he will risk his life to preserve it.
\par \~\~\tab In most cases, a Greenwood Ranger will align with any adventuring party who shares his affinity for nature, providing he agrees with their cause. A Greenwo
od Ranger tends to keep to himself, offering his opinion only when asked and deferring to the party's leader in most situations.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Secondary Skills:}{\fs24  Bowyer/Fletcher, Farmer, Forester, Woodworker/Carpenter.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Weapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24  A Greenwood Ranger's weapon proficiencies are limited to the following choices: axe (any), bow (any), crossbow (any), dagger, knife, quarterstaff, sling, spear, long sword, short sword.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Nonweapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24  }{\i\fs24 Bonus:}{\fs24  Herbalism. Required: Agriculture}{\i\fs24 . Recommended:}{\fs24  Carpentry, Endurance, Foraging*, Swimming, Trail Marking*, Weather Sense. }{\i\fs24 Barred:}{\fs24 
 Armorer, Blacksmithing, Fire-building, Engineering, Leatherworking, Mining, Mountaineering, Navigation*, Riding (Land-based and Airborne), Seamanship, Spelunking*, Stonemasonry, Weaponsmithing.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Armor/Equipment: }{\fs24 
A Greenwood Ranger can't wear armor. However, his bark-like skin provides comparable protection. At 4th level, the Greenwood Ranger's skin gives him an Armor Class of 5. For every level thereafter, the AC increases by 1; an 8th 
level Greenwood Ranger, for example, has an AC of 1. At 15th level, the Greenwood Ranger reaches his maximum AC of -6.
\par \~\~\tab Normally, Greenwood Rangers don't wear clothing aside from a cloth loincloth or simple smock. Thanks to their tough feet, shoes are un
necessary. Some Greenwood Rangers are fond of decorative pins made of gems or colorful minerals. Greenwood Rangers wear such pins by attaching them directly to their skin.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Species Enemy:}{\fs24  Any.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Followers:}{\fs24  A Greenwood Ranger will have at least one treant follower at some point career.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Special Benefits:}{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Speak with Plants:}{\fs24  The Greenwood Ranger can speak with plants at will. This ability is similar to the 4th level priest spell, except it requires neither components nor a casting time.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Photosynthesis:}{\fs24  Unlike a normal human, the Greenwood Ranger has no
 need to drink or eat. He receives nourishment directly from the sun. So long as he is exposed to sunlight at least an hour per day, he stays healthy. He suffers 1-2 points of damage every day he goes without exposure to the sun. Overcast days are suffici
ent to nourish a Greenwood Ranger.
\par \~\~\tab A Greenwood Ranger satisfies his thirst by dipping his feet in any pool or puddle of fresh water for 10 minutes every other day. Exposure to a light rain or soaking his feet in a bucket will also suffice. If he goes wit
hout water for 48 hours, he begins to suffer damage at the rate of 1-2 points per day.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Buoyancy:}{\fs24  A Greenwood Ranger requires oxygen like any other human and is subject to drowning and suffocation. However, because the Greenwood Ranger's woody skin makes
 him naturally buoyant, he can't drown unless he's physically held underwater.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Rooting:}{\fs24  Upon reaching 8th level, a Greenwood Ranger can accelerate healing by }{\i\fs24 rooting}{\fs24 . He may attempt this once per week. To use this ability, the Greenwood Ranger must bury
 his feet in the earth (not sand or snow; the soil must be capable of supporting plant life) up to his ankles. He must stand stationary and silent for 1-4 hours, taking no other actions during that time. If interrupted, the rooting fails; he may try again
 
the following week. If uninterrupted, tiny roots sprout from his feet and bury themselves into the ground, absorbing healing nutrients from the soil. At the end of the rooting period, the roots withdraw, and the Greenwood Ranger has recovered 3-12 (3d4) p
oints of damage.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Limbing: }{\fs24 Under certain circumstances, a Greenwood Ranger can grow an extra limb. The limb grows from the center of the Greenwood Ranger's chest and functions as a normal arm.
\par \~\~\tab Only Greenwood Rangers of 10th level or higher can attempt }{\i\fs24 limbing}{\fs24 
. A Greenwood Ranger may make an attempt once a month by lying on the ground and covering himself with leaves, branches, and earth. For the next 24 hours, he enters into a state of suspended animation, similar to that caused by a }{\i\fs24 temporal stasis
}{\fs24  spell. If the Greenwood Ranger is disturbed during this time, the enchantment is broken and limbing will not occur. The Greenwood Ranger can try again the following month.
\par \~\~\tab If the Greenwood Ranger is undisturbed, he awakens in 24 hours with a new limb extending from his chest. The new limb may be useful to the Greenwood Ranger in several ways:

The Greenwood Ranger can wield three weapons at the same time. Attacks made with the third weapon suffer a -2 penalty. The Greenwood Ranger's reaction adjustment (b
ased on his Dexterity) modifies this penalty, although it can't result in a positive modifier. The Greenwood Ranger gains only two additional attacks per round, regardless of the number of attacks he's normally allowed. Therefore, a Greenwood Ranger able 
to attack 3/2 with one weapon (once in the first round, twice in the second) can attack 7/2 when using three weapons (three times in the first round, four times in the second).

The third limb improves the Greenwood Ranger's performance when using certain nonweapon proficiencies involving the hands. For example, when using
 the juggling proficiency to catch items, he makes an attack roll vs. AC 2 instead of AC 0. When using the weaving proficiency, he can create three square yards of material per day instead of two. The DM determines the extent of the improvement depending 
on the particular proficiency and the attempted task.

rovides protection in most environments, the Greenwood Ranger risks damage from prolonged exposure to extreme temperatures. After any full day spent in a climate where the temperature is below freezing, or averages 100 degrees or more, a Greenwood Ranger 
must make a Constitution check. Failure results in the loss of 1-4 hit points.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Limited Magic:}{\fs24  A Greenwood Ranger can only learn and cast spells from the plant sphere. He uses the ranger's normal spell progression (given in Table 5 in Chapter 1).
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Reaction Penalty:}{\fs24 
 Because of his bizarre appearance, the Greenwood Ranger suffers a -3 reaction adjustment penalty when encountering any NPCs, with the exception of learned nobles, sages, and other high level characters of good or neutral alignment. Such worldl
y characters aren't intimidated by his appearance.

\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Guardian
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Description:}{\fs24  The Guardian is a self-appointed protector of the wilderness. Compelled by a strong sense of duty, he has assumed responsibility for an unsettled tract of land, doing his utmost 
to maintain it in its natural state and protect its animal occupants. Though he feels kindly towards woodsmen, elves, and others who share his respect for nature, he has little patience for those who would exploit the wilderness for gain or spite.
\par \~\~\tab A Gua
rdian constantly monitors the region he has sworn to protect. He scrutinizes the activity of strangers, advises travelers, and intercepts careless hunters. He keeps an eye out for fires, floods, and other natural disasters, and does what he can to comfort
 animals in times of crisis.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Domain:}{\fs24  All Guardians have a specific region that they protect. The DM should establish the boundaries of a Guardian's domain at the beginning of his career. There are no fixed rules for assigning domains, but in general, a 1
st level Guardian's domain shouldn't exceed a few square miles. The domain expands by several square miles each time the Guardian increases in level. By 5th level, a Guardian's domain might encompass a region about 20-25 miles across. By 15th level or hig
her, the domain might comprise an area the size of a small country.
\par \~\~\tab A Guardian's domain should correspond to his primary terrain. The domain is typically located in an uncivilized part of the world, such as a remote mountain range or unexplored jungle. T
wo or more Guardians may share an especially large domain, but such cases are rare.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Requirements:}{\fs24  Standard.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Primary Terrain:}{\fs24  Forest, Hill, Jungle,  Mountain, or Plains.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Role:}{\fs24  A Guardian operates of his own volition, having no official sanction or 
title. He carries out his custodial duties as he sees fit, taking whatever steps he deems necessary to protect his domain. Despite his independence, he usually maintains good working relationships with officials of bordering lands. The relationship benefi
t
s both parties. The Guardian notifies the officials of approaching armies or other potential threats, while the officials may provide help for problems the Guardian can't handle alone. Though many governments would jump at the chance to have such able war
riors in their employ, Guardians resist all such offers, and steadfastly maintain their autonomy.
\par \~\~\tab An adventuring party entering a Guardian's domain has a good chance of encountering the Guardian himself. A Guardian will usually agree to guide a party thr
ough his domain and--presuming the party's intentions are compatible with the Guardian's philosophy--assist them in their efforts. Though a Guardian is reluctant to leave his domain, he may do so if presented with a compelling reason, such as the ravaging
 of a pristine wilderness or a threat to the ecology in another land.
\par \~\~\tab Guardians t

\par \~\tab }{\b\fs24 Followers:}{\fs24  A Guardian acquires at least one human or demihuman follower at some point in his career. There are no other restrictions or recommendations.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Special Benefits:
\par }{\fs24 \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Bonus Sphere:}{\fs24  The Guardian has miner access to the Protection sphere.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Bonus Spells:}{\fs24  A Guardian can cast certain spells within the boundaries of his domain. These are detect evil (three times per day), and bless and commune with nature (once per week each).
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Revive Plants:}{\fs24  This ability enables the Guardian to r
evitalize any type of natural plant life suffering from drought, disease, insect infestation, or other forms of non-magical trauma. Dead plants can't be affected, nor can the Guardian invigorate plants beyond their normal limits (for instance, a Guardian 
can't cause an apple tree to blossom in the winter).
\par \~\~\tab The process requires 8 hours and can affect a square area whose sides are 10 yards times the Guardian's level (a 5th level Guardian can revive all of the plant life within a 50 yd. - 50 yd. square). Th
e Guardian can use this ability once per month.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Special Hindrances:}{\fs24  If a Guardian leaves his domain for any length of time, he must make arrangements for someone else to assume his duties. He may hire a caretaker, or assign temporary custody of his doma
in to a human or demihuman follower. There are no fixed penalties for a Guardian who fails to do this. However, should a Guardian abandon his responsibilities for more than a few days, the gods may deny him the use of the special benefits associated with 
this kit. If he's absent for longer periods--say, a few weeks--the gods may also deny him the use of all spells. The Guardian recovers use of his special benefits and spells as soon as he returns to his domain.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Justifier
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Description:}{\fs24  Some expeditions a
re so demanding and some foes so dangerous that they require the attention of a highly trained specialist whose combat skills far exceed those of the typical ranger. Enter the Justifier, a master tactician whose military instincts, fighting versatility, a
nd steely nerves places him in the first rank of elite warriors.
\par \~\~\tab Though the Justifier specializes in neutralizing monsters, his skills qualify him for a wide range of adventures. He may organize guerilla forces and lead them into hostile territories. He 
may stage reconnaissance operations to gather information concerning enemy strength and logistics. He may execute strikes against monster lairs, rescue hostages, or eliminate tribal leaders or spell casters. For a determined Justifier, no job is too diffi
cult, no enemy too formidable.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Requirements: }{\fs24 Justifiers must have minimum scores of 14 in Strength and Dexterity. They must be human and of lawful good alignment.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Primary Terrain:}{\fs24  Any.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Role:}{\fs24  Justifiers boast extensive training in weapon use, scouti
ng, warding, and outdoor survival. Some learn these skills in a regular standing military, others are trained by military orders. A few highly motivated individuals are self-taught. Justifiers are in high demand by rulers as army officers, as well as by p
rivate individuals who use them as bodyguards. Many hire themselves out as mercenaries or volunteer for causes that further their own ideals.
\par \~\~\tab As Justifiers thrive on action, most are eager to join adventuring parties. On occasion, freelance Justifiers ma
y demand a retainer from a party or a guaranteed percentage of any treasure found. But more often than not, a freelance Justifier will join a party without remuneration if their task is just and promises him the chance to exercise his combat skills.

\par \~\~\tab A J
ustifier's companions will find him disciplined, focused, and unyielding in his determination to accomplish his objectives. He socializes little, preferring instead to keep his body strong with punishing exercise and his mind sharp with quiet meditation. 
A natural leader in combat situations, he fights with grim intensity and fearless perseverance.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Secondary Skills:}{\fs24  Armorer, Bowyer/Fletcher, Forester, Hunter, Trapper/Furrier, Weaponsmith.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Weapon Proficiencies:}{\i\fs24  Recommended:}{\fs24  Bow (any), crossbow (any), dagger, sling, spear, sword (any). See Special Bonuses.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Nonweapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24  }{\i\fs24 Bonus:}{\fs24  Survival; in addition to having this proficiency in his primary terrain, the Justifier receives the proficiency in an extra terrain of his choice (see also, Special Hindrances).}
{\i\fs24  Recommended: }{\fs24 Alertness*, Blind-fighting, Bowyer/Fletcher, Camouflage*, Endurance, Falconry*, Hunting, Mountaineering, Navigation, Riding (Land-based), Rope Use, Running, Set Snares, Swimming, Weaponsmithing.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Armor/Equipment:}{\fs24 
 A Justifier has no special armor or equipment requirements. Though most Justifiers prefer light armor, such as leather, they can wear any type of armor and still hide in shadows and move silently. Refer to Table 13: Optional Armor Adjustments 
in Chapter 1 for adjustments to success chances.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Species Enemy:}{\fs24  Any. A Justifier is more respected by his enemies than other rangers, and therefore suffers only a -2 penalty on encounter reactions with his species enemy, and no penalty if there is a formal truce.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Followers: }{\fs24 Any.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Special Benefits:
\par }{\fs24 \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Weapon Specialization:}{\fs24  Because of his extensive combat training, the Justifier must use some of his initial proficiency slots to take one weapon specialization (see Chapter 5 of the }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook}{\fs24 
). The weapon of specialization is taken from the list of recommended weapons.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Stealth: }{\fs24 The Justifier receives a +5% bonus to his chance of hiding in natural surroundings and to his chance of moving silently.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Tactical Advantage:}{\fs24  This ability allows t
he Justifier and his companions to gain a combat advantage by studying the enemy and exploiting their weaknesses. The Justifier must spend at least a full, uninterrupted turn secretly observing an enemy or group of enemies prior to making an attack. At th
e
 end of this period, the Justifier makes a Wisdom check. If successful, the Justifier has correctly assessed the enemy's weaknesses and is able to maximize the timing of an attack. The Justifier and his party automatically surprise the enemy and gain the 
initiative for the first round. A Justifier can attempt to gain a tactical advantage only once in a particular encounter.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Unarmed Combat Expertise:}{\fs24  When fighting with his bare hands, the Justifier inflicts 1-4 points of damage on a successful attack roll
. If the Justifier throws an unmodified 20 on his attack roll, the victim suffers 1-4 points of damage and must also make a saving throw vs. paralyzation. If the throw fails, the victim is stunned for 1-6 rounds.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Coordinated Attack:}{\fs24  The Justifier can us
e this ability, in conjunction with a trained animal follower, to inflict maximum damage on an opponent. The animal follower must have been trained to attack on command (see the Training Followers rules in Chapter 3).
\par \~\~\tab To attempt a coordinated attack, th
e Justifier and the animal both make a single attack on the same enemy in the same round (even if one or both are normally allowed multiple attacks; the animal will use its most damaging attack). If either roll misses, then that attacker automatically los
e
s initiative in the next round. If both rolls hit, each attack causes twice the normal amount of damage. A coordinated attack involves only one follower. A coordinated attack may be attempted at any time during a combat, but only once against any particul
ar opponent during an encounter.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Special Hindrances:}{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Limited Proficiencies:}{\fs24  The Justifier's mastery of weapons and combat comes at the expense of learning other skills. For this reason, he receives only one nonweapon proficiency slot at 1st level (in 
addition to his Survival bonus). He acquires additional proficiency slots at the normal rate.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Limited Spell Use:}{\fs24  Because the Justifier devotes less time to the study of magic than to the military arts, he has less access to spells than other rangers. Th
e Justifier doesn't acquire spells until he reaches 10th level. Table 46 shows the Justifier's spell progression.

\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Mountain Man
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Description:}{\fs24  Some people find the lure of the wild irresistible. Having tasted the pleasure of life in its purest, most primitive state, these hardy souls reject the tra
ppings of civilization and wholeheartedly embrace the challenges of the untamed wilderness. These Mountain Men (and Women) spend their lives in relative isolation, enduring uncertain climates, hostile creatures, and chronic shortages of food and other vit
al supplies. They couldn't be happier.
\par \~\~\tab The typical Mountain Man is robust, courageous, and uncomplicated. Book learning and formal schooling mean far less than self-reliance and common sense. Though uneducated by conventional standards, the Mountain Man 
has mastered all the skills needed to survive. He can manufacture his own weapons from the crudest materials, brew potent medicines from wild herbs, and doggedly persist in strenuous physical labor when others have long since succumbed to exhaustion. Whil
e hunting wild game and navigating dangerous terrain may be daunting to an outsider, it's all in a day's work for the Mountain Man.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Requirements:}{\fs24  A Mountain Man must have a minimum Strength of 14 and a minimum Constitution of 15. The Mountain Man cannot be a full elf.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Primary Terrain:}{\fs24  }{\i\fs24 Required:}{\fs24  Mountains.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Role:}{\fs24  Mountain Men value privacy more than comfort. Accordingly, they make their homes in secluded caves or crude shacks hidden in remote mountain ranges. Many are nomadic, wandering from place to 
place with their possessions strapped to their backs, or carried by a bear or other loyal animal follower. They have little need for money, but occasionally procure goods from traveling salesmen or small town merchants, bartering with fur or hides.
\par \~\~\tab Even
 the most stubbornly independent Mountain Man hankers for human companionship now and then, which is one of the reasons he might agree to hook up with an adventuring party. Faced with a problem too formidable for him to tackle alone--such as an encroachme
nt from an enemy army or an infestation of powerful monsters--a Mountain Man may seek out an agreeable party to lend him a hand.
\par \~\~\tab The Mountain Man speaks his mind openly and directly, regardless of who he might offend. Etiquette is hardly his strong suit,
 nor is personal hygiene. While some party members may find the Mountain Man's straightforward approach to life refreshing, or even endearing, most will probably view him as an unsophisticated brute, gruff and ill-mannered. Some Mountain Men have a crude 
s
ense of humor that compels them to play adolescent practical jokes, such as leaving bear droppings in a companion's sleeping bag. The Mountain Man has little interest in art or philosophy, but is a natural storyteller and loves to tell outlandishly embell
ished tales--often of his own exploits. He approaches combat much as he does the other elements of his life, attacking with vigor.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Secondary Skills:}{\fs24  Bowyer/Fletcher, Fisher, Forester, Hunter, Miner, Trapper/Furrier.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Weapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24  A Mountain Man must choose his initial weapon proficiencies from among the following: axe (any), bow (any), crossbow (any), club, dagger, dart, javelin, knife, quarterstaff, spear, staff sling, warhammer.

\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Nonweapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24  }{\i\fs24 Bonus:}{\fs24  Mountaineering. Required: Hunting. }{\i\fs24 Recommended:}{\fs24

 Agriculture, Armorer, Blacksmithing, Boating*, Bowyer/Fletcher (included in the special Weaponsmithing bonus, described below), Charioteering, Engineering, Etiquette, Falconry*, Heraldry, Navigation, Reading/Writing, Seamanship, Spellcraft.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Special Bonus:}{\fs24  The Mountain Man also receives Weaponsmithing (Crude) as a bonus proficiency. He is restrict
ed to making the weapons listed in Table 47, and can only make weapons in which he is proficient. He uses stones, wood, and other naturally available materials, so these weapons are made at no cost. This proficiency can't be improved; that is, assigning a
dditional slots to Crude Weaponsmithing has no effect.
\par   \tab }{\i\fs24 Optional Rule:}{\fs24  If a weapon made of stone or bone scores a hit, roll 1d6. A stone weapon shatters on a roll of 1; a bone weapon shatters on a roll of 1 or 2 (as per }{\i\fs24 The Complete Fighter's Handbook}{\fs24 ).

. Once his career is begun, the Mountain Man may manufacture additional weapons in accordance with the rules for his Crude Weaponsmithing proficiency. He may also use weapons he obtains from his companions or other sources.
\par \~\~\tab A Mountain Man normally doesn
't wear armor. Instead, he wears a handmade suit of leather and fur which gives him an Armor Class of 8. A Mountain Man often decorates his suit with dyed porcupine quills or strings of colorful pebbles. He sometimes adds bone necklaces, elaborate leather
 fringes, or a hat made of beaver or raccoon skin.
\par \~\~\tab Though not strictly forbidden from wearing metal armor, a Mountain Man is so uncomfortable when doing so that he suffers a -2 penalty to all attack rolls.

\par \~\~\tab Though Pathfinders come from all walks of life, most have homelands in sparsely settled or exceptionally hostile terrains where learning to fin

\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Role:}{\fs24  Though some Pathfinders are retainers of kings or lords, most operate independently. Pathfinders are generally regarded as honest, although their services are rarely inexpensive.
\par \~\~\tab Being characters of high principle, Pathfinders often offer their services to parties undertaking adventures to promote the common good. Rarely will a Pathfinder join a party purely for gain, though
 he may consider such an arrangement when business is slow.
\par \~\~\tab As a member of an adventuring party, the Pathfinder usually finds himself in front, scouting the terrain ahead to ascertain the best route and spot potential hazards. Unless the Pathfinder has 
organized the party himself, he usually leaves the leadership role to someone else while he concentrates on trailblazing.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Secondary Skills: }{\fs24 Farmer, Forester, Groom, Hunter, Navigator, Trapper/Furrier.
\par }{\b\fs24 \~\~\tab Weapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24  A Pathfinder must fill an i
nitial weapon slot with the machete (see Chapter 7), hand axe, or sword; such weapons are useful for cutting away brush and clearing paths. Subsequent slots may be filled with any weapons of his choice (see also Special Benefits).
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Nonweapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24  }{\i\fs24 Bonus:}{\fs24  Direction Sense, Distance Sense*, Trail Marking*. Required: Alertness*. }{\i\fs24 Recommended:}{\fs24 
 Camouflage*, Endurance, Fire-building, Foraging*, Mountaineering, Navigation, Signaling*, Trail Signs*, Weather Sense.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Armor/Equipment:}{\fs24  Because he spends a lot of time on foot, the Pathfinder favors light armor, such as leather or padded. He seldom carries a shield. Otherwise, the Pathfinder has no particular preferences or requirements.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Species Enemy:}{\fs24  Any.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Followers: }{\fs24 All species are eligible, though the Pathfinder is likely to attract followers with higher movement rates (12+), as he tends to have little patience with creatures that can't keep up with him.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Special Benefits:
\par }{\fs24 \~\~\tab The first two benefits, }{\i\fs24 trail sense}{\fs24  and }{\i\fs24 overland guiding}{\fs24 
, apply only when the Pathfinder leads the party. At least 20 feet must separate the Pathfinder from the rest of the party; the proximity of others distracts the Pathfinder, making him unable to take advantage of these benefits.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Trail Sense:}{\fs24  The Pathfinder's chance of getting lost in any outdoor land setting is reduced by 10%. Furthermore, his base chance of getting lost in his primary terrain (i.e. the Surroundings column of Table 81 in the }{\i\fs24 
DUNGEON MASTER Guide}{\fs24 ) will not exceed 20%. This is not cumulative with other benefits, such as the one for the direction sense proficiency.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Overland Guiding:}{\fs24  A Pathfinder is able to find the optimum trail through rough terrain, increasing the party's movement rate when traversing long distances. To determine terr
ain costs for overland movement when a Pathfinder leads the party, use Table 49 in this book in place of Table 74 in Chapter 14 of }{\i\fs24 the DUNGEON MASTER Guide}{\fs24 
. The movement costs indicate points of movement spent per mile of travel; when moving through the va
rious terrain types, subtract the points from the total movement available to the party for that day. (Note that less rugged terrain types are relatively unaffected, as the optimum paths are usually obvious, even without the help of a Pathfinder.)

\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Marksmanship:}{\fs24  Owing to his steady hand and acute vision, the Pathfinder has a +1 bonus to the attacks made with a favorite missile weapon. It must be one in which he has proficiency and selected as a weapon of choice.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Recognize Trail Hazard.}{\fs24  By observing subtle changes in the terrain, the Pathfinder is able to recognize natural hazards, 
enabling him and his companions to avoid them. Typical hazards include quicksand, sinkholes, slippery slopes, and thin ice. A Pathfinder has no special ability to recognize man-made hazards, such as pit traps or dangerous bridges, nor does he have any spe
cial talent for anticipating encounters with hostile natives or animals.
\par \~\~\tab A Pathfinder's chance of recognizing a hazard is 10% per experience level; to a maximum chance of 90% at ninth level. If the DM determines that the Pathfinder is approaching an area
 containing a natural hazard, he secretly rolls percentile dice. If the roll is equal to or less than the Pathfinder's chance, the Pathfinder recognizes a potential hazard. (Optionally, the DM might only describe an unusual aspect of the terrain and let t
h
e Pathfinder come to his own conclusions. For example, if the Pathfinder is approaching a pool of quicksand, the DM might say that the ground feels exceptionally spongy. If the Pathfinder nears a patch of thin ice, the DM might point out that the ice ahea
d is discolored and laced with tiny cracks).
\par \~\~}{\b\fs24 \tab Special Hindrances:}{\fs24  By moving ahead of the party, the Pathfinder places himself in a position of risk. Separated from his companions, the Pathfinder is more likely to be the victim of enemy attacks. He runs a 
greater risk of drawing fire from snipers, and is more susceptible to ambushes from hostile creatures. If he fails to recognize a hazard, he'll probably be the first to become a victim.

\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Sea Ranger
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\tab }{\b\fs24 Description: }{\fs24 Though most rangers live and work on land,
 the Sea Ranger makes his home at sea. Whether sailing the ocean in a mighty galleon or riding a river's currents in a handmade raft, the Sea Ranger finds the world's waters an endless source of wonder. A sailor and an adventurer, he guards his watery dom
ain with vigilance, and counts many of its creatures among his friends and allies.
\par \~\~\tab He has an extensive understanding of weather patterns at sea and of the behavior of marine animals. He specializes in combat, both on and under the water. He may be a memb
er of a formal navy, an independent operator, or a mercenary. He may be charged with enforcing naval laws. Some Sea Rangers protect ports or fishing territories. Others  serve as escorts for trade fleets.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Aquatic Terrain:}{\fs24  For the purposes of this kit, Aquatic terrain includes oceans, lakes, ponds, and rivers, as well as coastlines, beaches, and small islands.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Requirements:}{\fs24  Because a Sea Ranger must master a wide range of knowledge he requires a minimum Intelligence score of 12. Because few elves and h
alf-elves have the temperament for the seaman's life, virtually all Sea Rangers are human (though being human isn't a strict requirement).
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Primary Terrain:}{\fs24  }{\i\fs24 Required:}{\fs24  Aquatic.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Role:}{\fs24  Sea Rangers have reputations as dedicated, sharp-minded professionals
. As such, they are often sought by adventuring parties in need of their special skills, particularly when an adventure takes them to aquatic environments or they expect to face opponents of oceanic origin. Though Sea Rangers generally prefer to remain at
 sea, they  travel on land as necessary to achieve the goals of their party. As many of a Sea Ranger's followers are waterbound, he obviously has less access to them when adventuring on land, a handicap he endures graciously but without enthusiasm.
\par \~\~\tab The e
nvironment has a profound effect on a Sea Ranger's attitude. On land, his party companions will find him hesitant and uncertain, following orders without comment and reluctant to offer advice. In an aquatic setting, however, he becomes a different person-
-confident, assertive, and commanding. Only the most stubborn or foolish parties will decline a leadership role to a Sea Ranger in watery terrain.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Secondary Skills:}{\fs24  Fisher, Navigator, Sailor, Shipwright, Trader/Barterer, Weaver.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Weapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24  }{\i\fs24 Recommended:}{\fs24  Dagger, knife, harpoon, sword (any), pole arm (any), trident;}{\i\fs24  Optional:}{\fs24  Belaying pin, cutlass, gaff/hook.
\par \~\tab }{\b\fs24 Nonweapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24  }{\i\fs24 Bonus:}{\fs24  Boating* or Seamanship; Swimming. }{\i\fs24 Recommended:}{\fs24  Cartography*, Direction Sense, Distance Sense*, Endurance, Fishing, Navigation, Riding (Sea-based)*, Rope Use. }{
\i\fs24 Barred: }{\fs24 Agriculture, Blacksmithing, Chari-
\par oteering, Falconry*, Mining, Mountaineering, Riding (Land-based), Spelunking*, Stonemasonry.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Armor/Equipment:}{\fs24  Because heavy armor interferes with swimming and makes moving around a ship uncomfortable, most Sea Rangers wear armor with an AC of 8 or less.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Species Enemy:}{\fs24  Any aquatic creature is eligible as a species enemy.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Followers:}{\fs24  The primary terrain of all animal followers must be Aquatic. Any full elf follower is 80% likely to be an aquatic elf.
\par \~\tab }{\b\fs24 Special Benefits:
\par }{\fs24 \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Sea Tracking:}{\fs24  Because of his knowledge of prevailing winds, currents, and other general aquatic conditions, the S
ea Ranger can effectively track waterborne craft and aquatic creatures. This is not so much a reading of physical signs as an instinctive deduction of the probable course and destination of the quarry. For purposes of general play, the Sea Ranger uses the
 normal Tracking proficiency check rules.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Land Scent:}{\fs24  When at sea, the Sea Ranger can smell the presence of land (including islands) within 50 miles. Further, if the Sea Ranger has ever been to that land before, he has a 10% chance per level of identifying it precisely.

\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Sea Legs:}{\fs24 
 The Sea Ranger has a fine sense of balance, which comes into play when he must fight on a narrow beam (such as a yardarm or boarding plank) or a pitching deck. Not only is he sure-footed under such conditions (avoiding any att
ack penalties for them), but any saving throws or Dexterity checks made to maintain his balance are made at a +2 bonus.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Aquatic Combat:}{\fs24  A Sea Ranger suffers no penalties to his attack rolls when in water; otherwise he follows the standard rules for underwater combat given in Chapter 9 of the }{\i\fs24 DUNGEON MASTER Guide.
\par }{\fs24 \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Parliament of Fishes:}{\fs24  When a Sea Ranger reaches 12th level, he may attempt to call a parliament of fishes. He may use this ability once per week. If successful, the Sea Ranger can demand a se
rvice of the school. Typical services include the location or recovery of small items, the provision of edible water plants, information about local monsters or conditions, and perhaps transport across a small body of water if the parliament members are l
arge enough. Once a month this can be the equivalent of a }{\i\fs24 commune with nature}{\fs24  spell.
\par \~\~\tab To call a }{\i\fs24 parliament of fishes}{\fs24 , the Sea Ranger locates a pond, lake, or any other body of water containing aquatic life. Sometime between sunset and dawn, he kneels besi
de the body of water and concentrates for a full turn. An attack or interruption in any other way during this time will break his concentration, and he can't attempt to call a}{\i\fs24  parliament of fishes}{\fs24  until the following week.
\par \~\~\tab Otherwise, at the end of 10 ro
unds, 10-100 (10d10) fish or other aquatic creatures (as appropriate to the body of water) surface and stare expectantly at the Sea Ranger. The Sea Ranger must then toss an offering into the water; the gift may be food, a coin, or any other object of the 
ranger's choice.
\par \~\~\tab The DM then rolls 1d10 and consults Table 50. If the offer was reasonably generous, increase the result by +1. If the offering was exceptionally valuable, increase the result by +2. If the offering was meager (a copper piece or a chunk of
 bread), decrease the result by -1. If the offering was essentially worthless (a bone or a chunk of rock), decrease the result by -2. The result can't be decreased below 1 or raised above 10.

\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Seeker
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Description:}{\fs24  Devoted t
o spiritual awareness and self-enlightenment, the Seeker's deep beliefs affect him more than any other elements of his life. The Seeker seeks fulfillment by following the tenets of his faith and striving to understand the relationship between himself and 
the natural world. He views animal followers as fellow travelers on his spiritual journey.
\par \~\~\tab Seekers can come from any culture, but typically originate from societies placing a premium on religion and scholarship. Many Seekers begin their spiritual quests 
as students of priests. Others are self-taught philosophers or restless academicians hungry for knowledge that can't be learned from books. Regardless of their background, all Seekers have felt compelled to embark on a wilderness pilgrimage that may last 
the rest of their lives.
\par \~\~\tab No particular religion is common to all Seekers. Some worship specific gods, while other
s venerate nature itself as an unknowable but all-encompassing force. All Seekers, however share a reverence for life and a philosophy that embodies discipline, and personal responsibility, and self-sacrifice.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Requirements: }{\fs24 A Seeker must have a Wisdom score of 15 or more. A particular religion may impose additional requirements, as determined by the DM.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Primary Terrain:}{\fs24  Any.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Role:}{\fs24  Good people of all cultures tend to look favorably on Seekers. At worst, Seekers are dismissed as useless but harmless 
eccentrics. More often, they're regarded as sensitive seekers of truth, admired and respected for their devotion. Priests of compatible alignment are especially deferential to Seekers; even if such a priest follows a different belief system, he recognizes
 that the Seeker shares his veneration of a higher power.
\par \~\~\tab Though Seekers generally prefer solitude, they constantly seek opportunities to broaden their outlook and stimulate spiritual insight. For these reasons, they may join adventuring parties solely f
or the promise of new experiences. Moral considerations also motivate Seekers; parties can sometimes recruit Seekers by appealing to their sense of justice.
\par \~\~\tab Typically, the companions of a Seeker will find him amiable, thoughtful, and comforting. Seekers
 aren't proselytizers--rarely are they interested in converting others to their beliefs--but they enjoy nothing more than debating philosophical issues. A companion who engages a Seeker in such a discussion may find himself listening to a detailed, schola
rly discourse that may last the better part of the day.
\par \~\~\tab Though Seekers usually decline to make decisions for the party, they often serve as counselors and advisors to the leaders. Non-aggressive by nature, Seekers avoid combat whenever possible, but figh
t fearlessly to thwart attacks against their followers or comrades. A Seeker is reluctant to take the life of another creature except to protect a companion, a follower, or himself, or to destroy his species enemy.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Secondary Skills:}{\fs24  Farmer, Forester, Groom, Mason, Scribe, Tailor/Weaver, Woodworker/Carpenter.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Weapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24  A Seeker receives only a single weapon proficiency at first level. This proficiency must be spent on one of the following weapons: club, light crossbow, dagger, dart, knife, 
quarterstaff, or sickle, sling. He cannot ever use a sword of any type.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Nonweapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24  }{\i\fs24 Bonus:}{\fs24  Religion.}{\i\fs24  Recommended:}{\fs24  Agriculture, Ancient History, Artistic Ability, Astrology, Carpentry, Cobbling, Etiquette, Languages (Ancient), Pottery, Readi
ng/Writing, Spellcraft, Veterinary Healing*, Weaving. The Seeker can take clerical proficiencies at the listed (non-doubled) costs.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Armor/Equipment:}{\fs24  In most cases, Seekers have no special equipment restrictions beyond those normally associated with rang
ers. However, Seekers worshipping particular gods or adhering to strict religious doctrines may have additional restrictions, as determined by the DM. Certain Seekers, for example, may be forbidden from using any bladed weapon or wearing any type of armor
. Such restrictions should be made clear at the outset of the Seeker's career.
\par \~\~\tab Seekers have little interest in material possessions. After keeping enough money to meet their basic needs, they typically give away the rest of their gold and treasure to the poor.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Species Enemy:}{\fs24 
 The species enemy must be evil. Alternately, a specific evilly-aligned religious group or cult may be taken, in which case members and minions of the group are considered the species enemy. Other common species enemies include ghou
ls (and other undead), evil dragons, death dogs, evil humanoids, etc.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Followers: }{\fs24 All creatures are eligible as followers, except the species designated as a sacred animal (see the Special Hindrances section).
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Special Benefits:
\par }{\fs24 \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Increased Access to Spells:}{\fs24  Unlike other rangers, the Seeker acquires spells when he reaches 6th level. He can also cast 4th level spells. Table 51 shows the Seeker's spell progression.
\par \~\~\tab The Seeker has access to spells from an extra sphere in addition to those of plant and 
animal. When reaching 6th level, he chooses an extra sphere from the following options: divination, healing, protection, weather. This extra sphere remains the same for the rest of his career.

\par }{\fs24 \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Mediation:}{\fs24  A Seeker must spend a full hour each day in silent meditation. This hour must always occur at the same time of day, such as the first hour of dawn or at high noon; 
once decided, it can never be changed. If a Seeker neglects to mediate or is interrupted more than once (for more than a total of two rounds), he suffers a -1 penalty to all ability checks and attack rolls the following day.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Sacred Animal:}{\fs24  Every Seeker 
has a sacred animal that symbolizes his ideals. A Seeker's sacred animal at the same time he is determined at the same time as the species enemy. The player selects the sacred animal from the options listed in Table 52, subject to the DM's approval; for e

ample, if the Seeker's primary terrain is Arctic, his sacred animal might be the polar bear, the snow leopard, or the seal. A Seeker retains the same sacred animal throughout his career. He cannot acquire a follower of the same species as his sacred anima
l. The player may choose a sacred animal other than those listed in Table 52, so long as it's different from the Seeker's species enemy.

\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Stalker
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Description:}{\fs24  At first glance
, this soft-spoken, rather nondescript character seems hopelessly out of place in an adventuring party, looking instead like an town dweller who's wandered into the wilderness by mistake. But the drab demeanor is only a facade, concealing keen senses, a s
hrewd mind, and remarkable insight. Only his closest friends realize the extent of his expertise in intelligence-gathering. And that's just the way he likes it.
\par \~\~\tab Stalkers serve as spies, informants, and interrogators. Unlike other rangers, Stalkers are co
mfortable in both wilderness and urban settings. A Stalker may covertly observe a bandit camp to inventory their supplies and hostages, or eavesdrop in the corridors of an evil wizard's castle. A few innocuous questions enable him to distinguish friend fr
om foe, and fact from fiction. His mastery of stealth makes him a deadly opponent.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Requirements:}{\fs24  A Stalker must have a minimum Intelligence score of 14. Stalkers must be human.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Primary Terrain:}{\fs24  Any; in addition, the Stalker's primary terrain can be Urban (see Special Benefits).
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Role:}{\fs24  Stalkers tend to be introspective and reflective, valuing intellect over physical prowess. They avoid drawing attention to themselves, seldom speaking unless directly addressed, then responding succinctly and without el
aboration. They avoid small talk and socializing, instead preferring the company of a good book or an hour spent examining an unusual footprint. Stalkers tend to suppress their emotions so their decisions aren't colored by what they consider to be irrelev
ancies.
\par \~\~\tab Though most people respect Stalkers, they are also wary of them. The Stalker's stealthiness and secrecy make many people uneasy, as these are traits usually associated with thieves and sneaks. But Stalkers value honor as much as any ranger, and n
obles rarely hesitate to hire one in times of crisis. A hired Stalker can be trusted to focus on the job at hand, complete it efficiently, make his report, then go his own way without comment.
\par \~\~\tab Adventuring parties often hire Stalkers on retainer, though 
occasionally, a Stalker will join a party with no assurance of monetary reward if the adventure presents an intriguing challenge. Stalkers rarely are party leaders, though they express their opinions freely when invited to do so. In combat, most Stalkers 
are brave but cautious, waiting for tactical opportunities to present themselves rather than charging into the fray. They prefer to surprise their opponents, striking silently and quickly.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Secondary Skills:}{\fs24  Any.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Weapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24  Stalkers become proficient only with weapons they can easily conceal. Their weapon proficiencies are limited to blowgun, dagger, dart, knife, short sword, staff, and sling. }{\i\fs24 Optional:}{\fs24 
 garrote, rapier (walking stick), stiletto.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Nonweapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24  }{\i\fs24 Bonus:}{\fs24  Alertness*, Camouflage*. }{\i\fs24 Recommended:}{\fs24  Blind-fighting, Etiquette, Modern Languages, Persuasion*, Signaling*, Trail Marking*, Trail Signs*.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Armor/Equipment: }{\fs24 A Stalker prefers to carry no more gear than he can comfortably strap to his back. He wears well-made but unpr
etentious clothing, similar to that of a laborer or peasant, that allows him to blend in with crowds. Though he can wear any type of armor (see Special Benefits) he favors leather. Stalkers almost never carry shields, finding them awkward and restrictive.

\par \~\~\tab At the beginning of his career, a Stalker receives a free "terrain suit" (see Chapter 7). The terrain suit corresponds to his primary terrain (night black for Urban).
\par \~\~\tab Species Enemy: Any. Optionally, the Stalker can declare a specific thieves' guild or assassin's guild as his enemy.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Followers:}{\fs24  Because a Stalker prefers to work unhampered, his followers are limited in number, species, and size. Though he receives a car
eer total of 2d6 followers like other rangers, a Stalker has only one follower at a time. A new follower won't appear until the Stalker's current follower dies or is dismissed. A Stalker won't acquire a new follower even if he releases his current followe
r or arranges for its care elsewhere; he must sever all ties with the old follower before another will arrive.
\par \~\~\tab A Stalker never accepts human or demihuman followers. Nor will he accept followers whose intelligence compares favorably with that of humans, s
uch as pixies or aarakocra, as he fears such beings are undependable and may cause unnecessary distractions. Because he wishes to minimize the chances of attracting attention, all animal followers must be less than four feet tall (size "S" or "T").
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Special Benefits:

\par }\pard \nowidctlpar\tx0\tx360{\*\pn \pnlvlcont\ilvl0\ls0\pnrnot0\pndec }\adjustright {\fs24 \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Interrogation:}{\fs24  When interrogating an NPC for any reason, a Stalker can acquire special knowledge about 
the NPC in one (but not both) of the following ways:
\par {\pntext\pard\plain\f3 \loch\af3\dbch\af0\hich\f3 \'b7\tab}}\pard \fi-360\li720\nowidctlpar\tx0\tx360{\*\pn \pnlvlblt\ilvl0\ls1\pnrnot0\pnf3\pnindent360 {\pntxtb \'b7}}\ls1\adjustright {\fs24 
By making a successful Intelligence check (use half the Intelligence score, rounded up), the Stalker can determine the general alignment of the NPC. If successful, the Stalker learns the good-evil component of the NPC's alignment (good, neutral, or evil).

\par {\pntext\pard\plain\f3 \loch\af3\dbch\af0\hich\f3 \'b7\tab}}\pard \fi-360\li720\nowidctlpar\tx0\tx360{\*\pn \pnlvlblt\ilvl0\ls1\pnrnot0\pnf3\pnindent360 {\pntxtb \'b7}}\ls1\adjustright {\fs24 
The Stalker can ascertain the NPC's honesty. The DM secretly makes an Intelligence check for the Stalker. If the check fails, the DM tells the Stalker nothing about the honesty of the NPC. The Stal
ker must make up his own mind about the NPC's reliability based on the NPC's responses.
\par }\pard \nowidctlpar\tx0\tx360{\*\pn \pnlvlcont\ilvl0\ls0\pnrnot0\pndec }\adjustright {\fs24 \~\~\tab 
If the check succeeds and the NPC is being honest with the Stalker, the DM tells the Stalker that the NPC is telling the truth to the best of his knowledge. A succes
sful check in no way compels the NPC to reveal any information to the Stalker. The NPC may refuse to cooperate, but the Stalker is assured of the truthfulness of anything the NPC decides to share (note that the NPC may still pass along unreliable informat
ion that he believes to be true).
\par \~\~\tab If the check succeeds, and the NPC is being dishonest with the Stalker, the DM tells the Stalker that the NPC may be lying. It's up to the Stalker to separate the truth from the lies; a successful check only tells him th
at he shouldn't take everything the NPC says at face value.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Photographic Memory:}{\fs24  When a Stalker reaches 10th level, he acquires a limited photographic memory, enabling him to recall details about anything he's seen or heard since achieving 10th level. H
e can recall a fragment of a conversation, conjure up a mental image of a place he's visited, or remember words on a printed page. To use this ability, the DM secretly makes an
 Intelligence check for the Stalker, with a -2 penalty. If the roll fails, the me
mory is too vague to be of any use to the Stalker. If the roll succeeds, the DM tells the Stalker what he wishes to remember. If the roll is a natural 20, the DM gives the Stalker intentionally misleading information about whatever he's trying to remember
 (a room, for instance, is incorrectly recalled as having a locked window or mysterious claw marks on the walls). Because of the mental stress involved, this ability can be used only once per day.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Special Hindrances:}{\fs24  Neither lawbreakers nor outlaws appre
ciate snoops. Typically, the harshest possible penalties are reserved for captured Stalkers. Should a band of orcs or goblins realize that a Stalker is in their midst, they're likely to chase him down and beat him mercilessly. A Stalker caught lurking in 
private residence will probably be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. An otherwise friendly NPC may be less likely to cooperate with the party if he recognizes one of the members as a Stalker.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Warden
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Description:}{\fs24  The Warden works for a noble,
 king, or wealthy land-owner, and is charged with managing and protecting a tract of land owned by his overlord. He keeps his overlord's land free of monsters, guards against spies and trespassers, intervenes when natural disasters occur, and sees to the 
welfare of the animal population. While a Warden may operate alone, making decisions as he sees fit, he ultimately answers to a higher authority.
\par \~\~\tab Areas overseen by Wardens vary by size and geography, depending on their overlords' holdings and interests. 
A Warden may be in charge of a game reserve or oversee a parcel of farmland. He may supervise a private park, or be responsible for undeveloped property in the mountains or desert. The size of a guarded land may range from a few square miles for Wardens j
ust beginning their careers, to vast estates for high-level Wardens. Generally, as a Warden's experience increases, so do the boundaries of the land he supervises.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Requirements:}{\fs24  As a representative of a greater lord, a Warden is required to deal diplomat
ically with a variety people from all walks of life. Therefore, a Warden must have a minimum Charisma of 12. A Warden cannot be of chaotic alignment.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Primary Terrain}{\fs24 : Any, though Forest and Plains are the most common. The primary terrain should correspond to the area the Warden is first assigned to supervise.
\par }{\b\fs24 \~\~\tab Role:}{\fs24  In most societies, Wardens occupy positions of modest status, comparable to those of mid-level bureaucrats or well-to-do merchants. Some are members of the military, but more often, they're
 aides to government officials or affluent civilians. Wardens tend to hold the same job for life.
\par \~\~\tab A Warden serves his lord with the loyalty of a good soldier. He tends to be fastidious in his behavior and strictly law-abiding, which also makes him a bit inflexible. To most Wardens, rules are rules, and there's not much middle ground.
\par \~\~\tab When an adventuring party enters a Warden's guarded area, 
he may agree to assist them for the sake of expediency; the sooner the party leaves his area, the sooner things will get back to normal. Conversely, a Warden may seek out a party to help with a particularly difficult task, such as ridding the guarded area
 
of destructive creatures or locating a treatment for a crop disease. Depending on the circumstances, a Warden may journey anywhere in the world; he is not bound to remain in his guarded area. However, a Warden will not undertake any adventure without dire
ct orders from, or with the express permission of his overlord.
\par \~\~\tab Other members of an adventuring party may find a Warden to be cordial but distant. A Warden's loyalties lie primarily with his overlord, not with his companions, and this can create stress f
or party members who insist on comradeship. Some Wardens are also prone to homesickness; the further an expedition takes him from his guarded area, the more anxious and sullen he may become.
\par \~\~\tab Nevertheless, a Warden's dedication and professionalism can only enhance a party's effectiveness. Many comply unwaveringly with orders from the party leader, offer pointed advice when needed, and fight courageously on the battlefield.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Secondary Skills:}{\fs24  Armorer, Bowyer/Fletcher, Farmer, Forester, Groom, Weaponsmith, Woodworker/Carver.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Weapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24  }{\i\fs24 Recommended:}{\fs24  Bow (any), crossbow (any), quarterstaff, pole arm (any), spear, sword (any).
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Nonweapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24  }{\i\fs24 Recommended:}{\fs24  Agriculture, Carpentry, Engineering, Etiquette, Falconry*, Heraldry, Hunting, Languages (Modern), Reading/Writing, Riding (Land-based), Stone Masonry.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Armor/Equipment:}{\fs24  Wardens have no special armor or equipment requirements. Depending on the affluence and generosity of the overlord, Wardens may have access to the finest equipment 
money can buy, such as gem-studded shields and onyx-tipped arrows. As a rule, Wardens take meticulous care of their gear, spending much of their free time honing their blades to razor-edge sharpness, and polishing their armor until it gleams like silver. 
Wardens affiliated with the government may wear elaborate uniforms emblazoned with medals, ribbons, and other service commendations.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Species Enemy:}{\fs24  Any, though the species enemy is often a creature that plagues the Warden's guarded land or torments his overlord (in human lands, this is likely to be brigands).
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Followers:}{\fs24  Any.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Special Benefits:
\par }{\fs24 \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Stipend:}{\fs24  A Warden in good standing with his overlord receives a monthly stipend commensurate with his responsibilities and experience. Wa
rden salaries average 30-50 gp per month, plus a monthly bonus of 10 gp times the Warden's level.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Expenses:}{\fs24  When undertaking an expedition on behalf of his overlord, the Warden may receive a small stipend to cover his expenses. A typical stipend ranges 
from 100-500 gp, depending on the length of the expedition, the level of the Warden, and the generosity of the overlord. The Warden may spend these funds only on goods and services directly relating to the success of the expedition. In lieu of money, the 
Warden may receive loan of a mount, weapons, or equipment necessary for the undertaking.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Annual Boon:}{\fs24  Once per year, the Warden can ask the overlord for a boon. It is traditional that this be granted insofar as the resources of the overlord (and the judg
ement of the DM) allow, although exceptionally greedy or ill-considered requests will reflect badly upon the Warden.
\par \~\~\tab Reaction Bonus: When representing his overlord, a Warden receives a +2 bonus to his reaction checks with all good and neutral  character
s of high social status (including aristocrats, government officials, and affluent citizens), regardless of their culture or whether he's met them before.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Special Hindrances:
\par }{\fs24 \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Accountability:}{\fs24  A Warden is held fully accountable for any actions that may
 reflect badly on his overlord. Should the Warden break the law, insult a noble, or otherwise behave improperly, his overlord will demand an explanation. An unsatisfactory explanation will result in a reprimand at best, and termination of his job at worst
. A terminated Warden is forced to abandon this kit, suffering all of the penalties described in the Abandoning Kits section elsewhere in this chapter.
\par \~\~\tab If a Warden receives expenses (as detailed in his Special Benefits), he must make a full accounting of
 his expenditures and return any excess funds at the conclusion of his expedition. Should a discrepancy be discovered, the Warden may be fined or imprisoned. If he's been given special equipment instead of or in addition to expenses, all items must be re
turned in good condition. Otherwise, money may be deducted from the Warden's stipend to replace them, or the overlord may confiscate an equivalent amount of the Warden's goods.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Overlord Demands:}{\fs24  A Warden is always subject to orders from his overlord. So
me orders are critical, others trivial, but all must be followed in order for the Warden to remain in good standing. Failure to comply with an order may result in a variety of penalties, ranging from fines to termination of employment.
\par \~\~\tab An overlord may r
equire the Warden to carry out a special order in conjunction with his primary assignment, or a Warden may receive burdensome duties as part of his regular job. In all cases, the DM decides when the overlord makes a special demand, the type of demand, and
 the penalties for violation. Some sample demands of a Warden:

\par }{\b\fs28\cf13 Abandoning Kits
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab 
Once a kit is chosen for a ranger, it can't be exchanged later in the game for a different one. However, unless otherwise specified, it can be abandoned entirely, the character continuing the game as a standard ranger; that is, a ranger as described in th
e }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook}{\fs24  without any of the benefits or hindrances associated with a particular kit.
\par \~\~\tab Why would a player want to abandon a kit? Maybe recent campaign events have made the kit less fun to play (the king has declared amnesty for all Forest Runner
s). Perhaps the player feels limited by the kit restrictions (he wants more spells than those allowed to the Greenwood Ranger). Or maybe he's just tired of it (the Sea Ranger is fed up with life on the water). Whatever the reason, the DM should honor a pl
ayer's request to abandon his kit. The abandonment may take place gradually, if the DM's wishes to work the change into an adventure, or immediately, if the DM doesn't see the change as significantly affecting the story line of his campaign.

\par 
\par \~\~\tab Players aren't restricted to the ranger kits described in this chapter. If a player is interested in a certain type of character not discussed here, he can design a new kit from scratch, using the above examples as guidelines.
\par \~\~\tab Before going to all the trouble of designing a new kit from the ground up, study the existing kits to see if any of them can be modified to fit the archetype you have in min
d. If not, copy the Ranger Kit Record Sheet in the back of this book. Begin by filling out the description of the new kit, then write down the information needed in each section. Refer to the Kit Subsections descriptions at the beginning of this chapter i
f necessary.
\par \~\~\tab When you've finished filling out the Record Sheet, let your DM look it over. He may make some adjustments to ensure that characters taking the new kit aren't too powerful or that the kit is sufficiently different from existing kits. The DM r
eserves the right to make additional adjustments after he sees how it works in the context of a campaign.
\par \~\~\tab Stuck for ideas? Here are some suggestions that might be developed into new kits:
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Crypt Ranger.}{\fs24  Cemeteries, battlefields, or other locales associated with death are his primary terrain. His followers are non-evil undead.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Dragon Killer.}{\fs24  Similar to the Giant Killer, he has special abilities that increase his effectiveness when fighting dragons.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Extra-Planar Ranger.}{\fs24  His primary terrain is another plane of existence. His followers include extra-planar creatures.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Militant Ecologist.}{\fs24  He's a conservation expert who retaliates violently against despoilers, polluters, and poachers.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Lycanthropic Ranger.}{\fs24  He can change into an animal and counts werecreatures among his followers. Werebears and weretigers are suggested.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Ranger-Knight.}{\fs24  He's a private landowner primarily interested in protecting and expanding his own holdings.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Survivalist.}{\fs24  He can thrive in any terrain, under any conditions. He can improvise deadly weapons from the simplest materials.

\par }{\b\fs28\cf13 Demi-Rangers
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab According to the }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook}{\fs24 , only humans, elves, and half-elves can be rangers. But using the rules in this book, it's possible to include characters of other races with ranger

\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 New Kits for Demi-Rangers
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab Just as you're free to create new ranger kits, it's also possible to design kits specifically for demi-rangers. Follow the suggestions outlined in the Creating New Kits section above. The DM has the right to disallow }{\i\fs24 any}{\fs24 
 kit he feels is inappropriate for his campaign.
\par \~\~\tab Some suggestions for demi-ranger kits:
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Dwarven Spelunker.}{\fs24  This is a subterranean ranger whose primary terrain encompasses caves and underground passages.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Gnomish Terraformer.}{\fs24  He pursues techniques for physically reshaping the lay of the land.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Halfling Agronomist.}{\fs24  He's a master of agriculture and animal husbandry.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Dual-Classed Rangers
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab Dual-classed characters must be human. A dual class ranger may be of any character kit, presuming the DM allows it in his campaign.
\par \~\~\tab To change from a ranger to another class, the ranger must have a minimum score of 15 in Strength, Dexterity, and Wisdom. He must have a score of 17 or better in the prime requisites of the new class.
\par \~\~\tab If a character from another class wants to switch to a ranger, he must have a minimum score of 15 in his prime requisites and a score of 17 or better in Strength, Dexterity, and Wisdom.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Multi-Class Rangers
\par }{\fs24 
\par    \tab The main multi-class option open for a ranger is the half-elf cleric/ranger. The half-elf advances in both classes simultaneously, up to 16th level ranger and 14th level cleric. All the usual rules for multi-class characters as given in the }{
\i\fs24 Player's Handbook}{\fs24  should be followed.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24 Optional Rule: The Ranger-Druid
\par }{\fs24 \~\~\tab Generally, a ranger/druid combination is not possible, due to the conflicting alignments of the classes. However, campaign conditions may allow their creation, should the players and DM decide that they wish to experiment with them.

\par \~\~\tab First, there must be a nature deity of good alignment whose specialty priests are druidic. Second, the priesthood must have an allied group of rangers. Given these conditions, a half-elf ranger/druid character may be possible.
\par \~\~\tab Such a character is still bound by racial level limits, in this case 16th level ranger and 9th 
level druid. Even if the optional level advancement for exceptional ability scores is used, such a character is unlikely to become a 12th level druid (a level for which the character must fight). At the very least, the character will have formidable enemi
e
s among conservative members of the priestly hierarchy, and is likely to become the target of subtle plots. Also, such a character would be under constant pressure from divided loyalties, as his chosen professions will tend to pull him in different direct
ions.
\par }{\b\fs32\cf13 
\par 
\par Chapter 5: Proficiencies
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab It's strongly suggested that you incorporate the optional proficiency rules into your campaign, especially if you're using the character kits from Chapter 4. This chapter presents all of the nonweapon proficiencies relevant to the ranger from the }{
\i\fs24 Player's Handbook}{\fs24 , along with descriptions of a few new ones and clarifications of some old ones.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf13 Compiled Proficiencies
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab 
Table 55 lists all of the nonweapon proficiencies normally available to the ranger, which includes all of the proficiencies associated with the warrior, wizard, and general groups. Rangers may also acquire proficiencies from the priest and rogue groups de
scribed in Chapter 5 of the }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook}{\fs24 , but at a cost of one additional proficiency slot above the listed number.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Bold-faced}{\fs24  entries are new proficiencies described in this chapter.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Italicized }{\fs24 entries require the player to select a specific are
a of specialization. For instance, a ranger proficient in artistic ability must specialize in one particular art form, such as painting, sculpture, or origami. Spending another slot on this proficiency allows him to improve an already chosen art form, or 
to pick another one.

\par }{\b\fs28\cf13 Clarifications and Modifications}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \~\~\tab The following modifications are used in addition to the information in the proficiency descriptions given in Chapter 5 of the }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook}{\fs24 
. The modifications apply to rangers only. Except where specified otherwise, rangers must spend the slot points indicated in Table 55 to acquire any proficiency.
\par \~\~\tab Whenever a proficiency bonus is indicated, the bonus is added to the normal check modifier. For example, if a terrain-specialized ranger with a Wisdom of 14 uses direction sense (Wis +1) in his primary te
rrain (+2), the check is made at Wis +3. A roll of 17 or less on 1d20 is a success.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Animal Handling
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab A ranger's animal empathy ability (see Chapter 2) can produce essentially the same calming effect on an animal as the animal handling proficiency. If a
 ranger also has the animal handling proficiency, he may attempt to soothe an animal either by making a proficiency check or by using his }{\i\fs24 animal empathy}{\fs24  ability--but not both.
\par \~\~\tab If an animal is among a ranger's followers, neither animal empathy nor the animal handling proficiency is necessary to control the follower. Use the guidelines in Chapter 3 instead.
\par \~\~\tab The animal handling proficiency has no effect on a ranger's species enemy.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Animal Training
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab Rangers are more efficient than other characters at 
training animals. In the Standard method (see Chapter 3) a ranger needs two months to train an animal to perform a general task. Training for a specific trick requires 2d4 weeks. At the end of the training period, he makes a proficiency check. If the chec
k
 is successful, the animal has learned the task or trick. If the check fails, the ranger may make a second attempt at teaching it the same task (requiring another two months) or trick (requiring another 2d4 weeks), followed by a second proficiency check. 
I
f this second proficiency check fails, the animal is too dumb or too stubborn to learn that particular trick or task. The ranger may repeat the training process with a different trick or task. An animal can learn a maximum of 2d4 tasks or tricks, in any c
ombination of the two.
\par \~\~\tab The animal training proficiency isn't necessary to train followers. Use the guidelines in Chapter 3 instead.
\par \~\~\tab A species enemy can't be trained by the ranger, neither with the follower guidelines nor the animal training proficiency.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Riding, Airborne and Land-based
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab A ranger cannot use his species enemy as an airborne or land-based mount. If the mount is a follower, use the guidelines in Chapter 3 instead of the proficiency rules.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Survival
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab All rangers have basic survival sk
ills in their primary terrain. Additional proficiency slots may be spent to add more terrain types. Thus, if a ranger spends slots to acquire this proficiency, he must choose a terrain type other than his primary terrain, giving him the survival proficien
cy in two types of terrain.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Tracking
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab Most rangers will have this proficiency in outdoor land terrain without spending any slots, as discussed in Chapter 2. Generally, success chances in urban, man-made, or aquatic terrains are halved, unless a specific
 kit description says otherwise. Some kits give tracking in alternative terrains instead of the usual outdoor land environment.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf13 New Proficiencies
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab Rangers of any character kit can acquire these proficiencies by spending 
the points listed in Table 55. The "Crossover Groups" mentioned at the end of the description are eligible to buy the proficiency at the normal cost. Groups not mentioned may buy the proficiency by paying one additional point beyond the listed cost.

\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Alertness
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab 
A character with this proficiency is exceptionally attuned to his surroundings, able to detect disturbances and notice discrepancies. A successful proficiency check reduces his chance of being surprised by 1. (This replaces the description of this
 proficiency in}{\i\fs24  The Complete Thief's Handbook}{\fs24 .)
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Crossover Groups:}{\fs24  General.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Boating
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab This proficiency allows the character to pilot any small boat, such as a kayak or canoe, operating it at maximum speed. It also allows make minor repairs and improve
ments in these boats, such as waterproofing them and patching holes. A successful proficiency check enables the character to handle the craft in treacherous situations; for instance, maneuvering the boat though choppy water without capsizing it, or avoidi
n
g collisions when guiding it through a narrow channel choked with rocks or ice. Note that while the navigation and seamanship proficiencies deal with ships in oceans, seas, and other large bodies of water, the boating proficiency is confined to small craf
t on rivers, lakes, on oceans close to shore, and over similar terrain, usually on relatively calm waters.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Crossover Groups:}{\fs24  General.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Camouflage
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab By using this proficiency, the character can attempt to conceal himself, his companions, and inanimate o
bjects by using natural or man-made materials. Successful use assumes the availability of all necessary materials. In forests and jungles, the character can use shrubbery, mud, and other readily available resources. Arctic or similarly barren terrain usua
l
ly requires special clothing, paints, or other artificial materials (although "digging in" is an old trick which may be applicable in such terrain, depending on local conditions). It takes a character a half-hour to camouflage himself or another person, t
wo or three hours to conceal a cart or inanimate object of comparable size, and a half-day to hide a small building.
\par \~\~\tab Neither human, demihuman, monster, nor animal passersby will be able to see a camouflaged character, presuming the character makes a succ
essful proficiency check. Camouflaged companions will also go unnoticed; only one proficiency check is required for the entire group.
\par \~\~\tab Objects may also be camouflaged. Objects the size of a person require no penalty to the check; cart-sized objects require a -1 penalty, while building-sized objects require a -3 penalty. The DM may adjust penalties based on these guidelines.

\par \~\~\tab Camouflaging has no effect on predators that locate prey by scent or other keen senses; a hungry wolf can still sniff out a camouf
laged human. A camouflaged person has no protection against a passerby who accidently brushes against or bumps into him. Likewise, a camouflaged person may reveal himself if he sneezes, cries out from the sting of a bee, or makes any other sound.
\par \~\~\tab Note that camouflaging is only necessary for persons or objects that would otherwise be partially or entirely exposed. A person hiding behind a stone wall wouldn't need to be camouflaged to avoid detection, nor would a buried object.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Crossover Groups: }{\fs24 Fighter, Rogue.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Cartography}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \~\tab This proficiency grants skill at map making. A character can draw maps to scale, complete with complex land formations, coastal outlines, and other geographic features. The character must be reasonably familiar with the area being mapped.
\par \~\~\tab The DM makes a proficiency check in secret to determine the accuracy of the map. A successful proficiency check means that the map is correct in all significant details. If the roll fails, the map contains a few errors, possibly a significant on
e. A roll of exactly 20 means the map contains serious errors, making it useless.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Crossover Groups:}{\fs24  General.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Distance Sense
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab This proficiency enables a character to estimate the total distance he's traveled in any given day, part of a day, or a nu
mber of consecutive days equal to his level. For instance, a 7th level character can estimate the distance he's traveled in the previous week. The estimate will be 90% accurate.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Crossover Groups:}{\fs24  General.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Falconry
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab This is most properly the Animal T
raining (Falcon) proficiency. A character with this proficiency is an expert in training and handling falcons, enabling him to teach them tricks and tasks (This proficiency also allows the training of hawks at a -1 penalty. Owls are a separate proficiency
 and can be trained at -2).
\par \~\~\tab A character can teach a falcon 2d4 (2-8) tricks or tasks in any combination. It takes 2d6 weeks to teach the falcon a trick, three months for a task. At the end of a training period, the character makes a proficiency check. If
 the check succeeds, the falcon has learned the trick or task. If the check fails, the falcon is incapable of learning more.
\par \~\~\tab If not using falconry training equipment (see Chapter 7), the success roll required for training is penalized by -2.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Crossover Groups: }{\fs24 General.
\par 
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Note:}{\fs24  The foregoing is the standard proficiency. Optionally, the training rules for rangers given in Chapter 3 can be used. Training times and number of tricks/tasks may vary.
\par 
\par \~\~\tab Sample general tasks:
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Hunting:}{\fs24  The falcon is trained to hunt its natural prey: small mammals and game birds; and to return with them to the falconer. Nearly all trained falcons receive this training first.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Ferocity: }{\fs24 The falcon receives a +1 bonus to all attack and damage rolls, and a +2 morale bonus.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Guard:}{\fs24  The falcon shrieks at the approach of strangers. If approached closer than 20' or 30', the falcon will attack unless ordered not to. The bird can recognize designated friends.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Homing:}{\fs24  The falcon recognizes one place as its roost and returns there upon command.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Loyalty:}{\fs24 
 The falcon is exceptionally loyal to an individual selected by the trainer. It has a +4 saving throw bonus against charm, control, empathy, or friendship attempts by others. Further, it comes when the individual summons it, gua
rds its master from attack and may perform unusual acts of loyalty as decided by the DM.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Species Enemy:}{\fs24  The falcon is trained to recognize an entire species as a natural enemy. Its basic reaction will be hostile, it will reject empathy, and have a +4 sa
ving throw bonus against the enemy's charm or control attempts. It will attack the species enemy in preference to others.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Track:}{\fs24  The falcon will track a designated creature and return. It can retrace its path to lead the falconer to the creature.
\par 
\par \~\~\tab Sample specific tricks:
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Attack:}{\fs24  The falcon will attack on command a creature designated by the falconer until called off. The falcon's base morale is at least 11. The falcon receives a save vs. rods against another ranger's animal empathy ability.

\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Capture Prey:}{\fs24  A hunt-trained falcon will return with the prey alive and unharmed.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Catch Object:}{\fs24  Upon command, the falcon will catch a small object thrown into the air or a small falling object and return to the falconer.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Distract:}{\fs24  The falcon is trained to feint at an opponent. The opponent must make a saving throw vs. paralysis or lose its next action.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Eye Attack:}{\fs24  The falcon is trained to strike at an opponent's eyes. A beak hit has a 25% chance of striking an eye. An opponent s
truck in the eye is blinded for 1d4 rounds and has a 10% chance of permanently losing sight in the eye.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Hand Signals:}{\fs24  The falcon can be commanded by hand signals as well as by voice.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Hide Object:}{\fs24  The falcon takes an object from the falconer, flies away with it, and conceals it. The falcon will retrieve the object on command.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Pit Fighting: }{\fs24 The falcon is trained as a fighting bird. It has a +2 attack bonus against any fighting bird that is not so trained.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Recall:}{\fs24  The falcon will immediately return to the falconer upon receiving the command.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Nemesis:}{\fs24  The falcon is trained to attack a specific individual. The falcon never checks morale when attacking the individual.

acter can search a wilderness area to locate a small amount of a desired material, such as a branch suitable for carving into a bow, enough kindling to start a fire, a medicinal herb, or a component required for a spell. The character must spend 2-8 (2d4)
 
hours searching, and the material must theoretically be available in the area being searched (for instance an icicle isn't available in the desert, nor dry kindling on the ocean floor). The DM doesn't confirm if the material sought is actually available u
ntil after the character has searched for the designated period. If the DM decides the material isn't in the area, no proficiency check is necessary; he merely reveals that the search was in vain.
\par \~\~\tab If the DM decides the material is indeed available, a suc
cessful proficiency check means the character has found what he's been looking for. As a rule of thumb, the character locates no more than a handful of the desired material, though the DM may make exceptions (if searching for a few leaves of a particular 
herb, the character may instead find an entire field).
\par \~\~\tab If the check fails, the material isn't found. The character may search a different area, requiring another 2-8 hours and a new proficiency check.

This proficiency enables the character to make a compelling argument to convince a subject NPC character to see things his way, respond more favorably, or comply with a request. The character engages the NPC in conversation for at least 10 rounds (meaning
 that the subject must be willing to talk with the character in the first place); subjects whose attitudes are threatening or hostile aren't affected by this proficiency.
\par \~\~\tab A successful proficiency check means that the subject's reaction is modified by +2 in favor of the character (see Table 59 in Chapter 11 of the }{\i\fs24 DUNGEON MASTER Guide}{\fs24 ). This bonus is }{\i\fs24 not}{\fs24 
 cumulative with any other reaction modifiers, such as those derived from Charisma; other reaction modifiers don't apply. For every additional slot a chara

The character can urge the mount to leap over obstacles in the water that are less than 3' high and 5' across (in the direction of the jump). No proficiency check is required. Greater jumps require a proficiency check, with bonuses or penalties assigned b
y the DM according to the height and breadth of the obstacle and the type and size of mount. Failure means the mount balks; an immediate second check determines if the character stays on the mount or falls off.

\par \~\~\tab Because signaling is essentially a language, messages of reasonable complexity can be communicated. A practiced signaller can transmit as many as 10 words per combat round.
\par \~\~\tab To interpret the signal, the recipient must be able to see or hear it. He must also have the signaling proficiency and know the same signaling method as the sender. To send a 
message and have it understood, both the signaler and the recipient must make successful proficiency checks. If one fails his roll, the message is distorted; the message can be sent again in the following round, and proficiency checks may be attempted aga

\par \~\~\tab By notching trees, scattering pebbles, piling stones, and clipping weeds, the character can mark a trail through any wilderness
 area. Providing he moves at 2/3 his normal movement rate, he can mark a continuous trail as long as he likes; however, the longer the trail, the less likely he'll be able to follow it back.
\par \~\~\tab A successful proficiency check enables a backtracking characte
r to follow his own trail for a distance equal to his level in miles. If he fails a check, he loses the trail. For instance, assume a 3rd level character marked a 12-mile trail. His first successful proficiency check enables him to follow this trail back 
three miles. A second successful proficiency check means he can follow the trail another three miles. The third check fails, and he loses the trail; he's only been able to follow his trail for a total of six miles.
\par \~\~\tab The tracking proficiency isn't necessar
y to use the trail marking proficiency. However, when a ranger loses his own marked trail, he may still attempt to follow it using his tracking proficiency. Any other characters with the tracking proficiency may also attempt to follow a ranger's marked tr
ail, using the rules applicable to the tracking proficiency.
\par \~\~\tab A marked trail lasts unless it is obscured by precipitation, a forest fire, or the p
assage of time (an undisturbed trail marked in a forest should last for weeks, while an arctic trail may last less than a day during periods of heavy precipitation; the DM decides). A ranger or other character with the tracking proficiency may still attem

\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab A ranger who reaches 8th level can learn and use certain spells. Unlike a wizard, he doesn't need a spell book, nor does he need to roll to learn spells. Instead, he obtains spells like a priest, acquiring the spells he wants to memorize
 through meditation and prayer. Chapter 8 examines the relationship between rangers, priests, and faiths in more detail.
\par \~\~\tab Unlike priests, rangers have access to spells only from the animal and plant spheres. As shown on Table 5 in Chapter 1, a ranger can
 cast spells at an increasingly higher level as he himself advances in level; a 9th-level ranger casts spells as a 2nd-level caster, while a 12th-level ranger casts spells as a 5th-level caster. Also note that a ranger can choose to memorize }{\i\fs24 any
}{\fs24  plant or anima
l sphere spell of the level shown on Table 5; for instance, a 13th-level ranger can have any three 1st-level spells from the plant and animal spheres and any two 2nd-level spells from the  plant and animal spheres memorized at one time.

\par 
\par \~\~\tab This spell allows the caster to heal an animal by transferring life force (hit points) from himself to the animal. If the animal is touched with one hand, it regains 1d4 hit points, just as if it had received a }{\i\fs24 cure light wounds}{\fs24 
 spell. Touching the animal 
with both hands restores 2d4 hit points. In either case, the caster temporarily loses the number of hit points that the animal regains. The caster will recover his lost hit points 1-4 hours later (if he transferred 3 hit points, he recovers 3 hit points i
n 1-4 hours). The caster's recovery of these hit points has no effect on the restored animal.
\par \~\~\tab During the 1-4 hours before the caster recovers his transferred hit points, he feels weak and dizzy, making all attack rolls at a -1 penalty during that time. S
hould the ranger die during that 1-4 hour period, the recovery process stops immediately and no hit points are recovered.
\par \~\~\tab The animal cannot recover hit points beyond the normal allotment. For instance, an animal that normally has 10 hit points, but has 
been reduced to 6 due an injury, can't receive more than 4 hit points from this spell. Also, the caster will have at least 1 hit point remaining after using this spell; if the caster has 6 hit points, he won't transfer more than 5 to a damaged animal.

\par \~\~}{\i\fs24 Revitalize animal}{\fs24  works on animals only; it has no effect on humans, demihumans, humanoids, magical creatures, etc. The spell is not reversible; that is, an injured caster can't receive hit points from an animal.

rve a suitable face in one turn.
\par \~\~\tab After carving the face, the ranger spends 1 turn casting the spell, at which time the face becomes animated, twitching and grimacing as if just awakening from a long sleep. The tree face then looks at the caster expectant
ly, waiting for a question. The caster may ask the tree any single question that can be answered in a single word or short phrase. Typical questions might include: "Has a dragon passed this way within the last few days?" "Has it rained here recently?" "Ar
e there any fruit trees nearby?" The tree answers the question honestly. If the question is beyond the scope of its knowledge, the tree says, "I don't know." After answering, the face disappears.
\par \~\~\tab The DM should keep in mind that a typical tree doesn't kno
w very much, as it has little experience, never travels, and rarely interacts with other living things in meaningful ways. As a rule of thumb, a tree's knowledge is limited to things it has observed (passersby, weather conditions) and general information 
about the immediate area (animal populations, location of landmarks). A tree can't give dependable advice or make judgements. If the DM is in doubt about what a particular tree knows, the tree answers, "I don't know."

is spell at all.
\par \~\~\tab The animal can't execute a trick or task that exceeds its physical limitations. A snake can't pick a lock, and a horse can't play a trumpet. Note also that the caster must give specific instructions, not general commands. If the caster c
ommands a lion to "Get something to help me put out this fire," the puzzled lion won't know what do to. However, if the caster says, "Take this bucket in your mouth, dip it in the stream, and carry the water back to me," the lion will do as it's told.

\par \~\~\tab T
he caster can take other actions while the animal is completing the trick. Once the animal completes its trick, the caster may give it additional tricks to complete until the spell expires. If the spell expires while the animal is in the middle of a trick
, or if the spell is broken by some means, the animal immediately stops what it's doing.

\par }{\b\fs24 Polymorph Plant}{\fs24  (Alteration)
\par 
\par Sphere: Plant
\par Range: Touch
\par Components: V, S, M
\par Duration: Permanent
\par Casting Time: 6
\par Area of Effect: One plant
\par Saving Throw: None
\par 
\par \~\~\tab This 
spell enables a ranger to transform any single plant, including a fungus or mold, into any other type of plant of the ranger's choice. The change is permanent. The changed plant has the physical appearance of its new form, but not all of the associated pr
o
perties. If edible, the new form tastes as bland as cotton. If normally used as a spell component, the new form has only a 50% chance of actually functioning as a component. If normally used for medical purposes (such as for a healing salve or poison anti
dote), the new form has only a 50% chance of having any beneficial properties.
\par \~\~\tab Only living plants can be polymorphed; the spell won't work on a fallen leaf, a nut, or a picked fruit. The size of the plant is not relevant; a blade of grass may be polymorp
hed into a towering oak tree and vice versa. The new form doesn't have to be indigenous to the environment; an evergreen tree on a frigid mountain may be polymorphed into a cactus (although it may not thrive for long).
\par \~\~\tab Neither the original vegetation no
r its polymorphed form can be an intelligent plant or a plant-like creature. Nor are unnatural plant forms allowed; a mushroom may be transformed into a normal-sized cornstalk, but not a 50-foot-tall cornstalk or a stalk that produces apples instead of co
rn.
\par \~\~\tab The material component for this spell is any seed.

\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab The following magical items are intended for rangers, but if the DM so chooses, he may allow fighters, wizards, and other character classes to use them, too. All of these items are re
latively rare and should turn up no more often than a typical item listed in the Miscellaneous Magic Tables in Appendix 2 of the}{\i\fs24  DUNGEON MASTER Guide}{\fs24 ; if you like, you may use any of these items as an option when a DM's Choice is rolled.

\par }{\b\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab Chameleon}{\fs24  }{\b\fs24 Cloak.}{\fs24 
 This lightweight cloak, which covers the wearer from neck to foot and also includes a hood, may be worn comfortably over studded leather or lighter armor. The color of the cloak automatically changes to blend in with the surrounding terrain. If the wear
er enters a jungle, the cloak becomes mottled with patches of green and brown. If the wearer enters a plain of snow, the cloak turns white. At night, the cloak becomes black. The color changes are instantaneous.
\par \~\~\tab A }{\i\fs24 chameleon cloak}{\fs24  allows a character to be personally camouflaged, as if using the camouflage proficiency, in any terrain. The }{\i\fs24 chameleon cloak}{\fs24 
 can only conceal one person at a time. The cloak conceals with an effective Wisdom equal to its rating.

\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Horn of Animal Calls (1200XP).}{\fs24  This wooden instrument, painted bright red with tiny silhouettes of vario
us animals along the sides, resembles a recorder about six inches long. The instrument can duplicate the cries and calls of any animal. The user closes his eyes, pictures the animal in his mind, then blows into the instrument. The sound is indistinguishab
l
e from the cry of the actual animal. The instrument can be used to call particular animals or frighten them away. The DM determines the effect of any particular use of the horn; for example, summoning 2d4 animals might be 80% likely in an animal's home te
rrain, with an arrival time of 1-4 rounds.
\par 
\par \~\~}{\b\fs24 \tab Ice Box (800 XP).}{\fs24  This is an airtight box one foot square, made of black metal with a single hinged panel. Opening the panel reveals the hollow interior. Centered on the outside of the panel is a white metal po
inter resembling a small arrow. This pointer can be rotated in any direction to regulate the temperature inside the box. If pointed straight up (toward the hinges), the temperature remains at 70 degrees F. For every complete clockwise rotation of the arro
w
, the temperature inside the box drops 1 degree. Therefore, if the arrow is rotated 30 times, the temperature drops to 40 degrees F. Rotating the arrow counter-clockwise raises the temperature 1 degree per rotation. The temperature can't be lowered below 
zero degrees or elevated beyond 70 degrees. The box is useful for making ice and preventing food spoilage.
\par 
\par \~\~}{\b\fs24 \tab Portable Shadow (1,000 XP).}{\fs24  Similar in appearance to a }{\i\fs24 portable hole}{\fs24 , a }{\i\fs24 portable shadow}{\fs24  resembles a gauzy black circle about 10 feet in diameter t
hat can be folded up into a packet about 6 inches square. When unfolded and laid on any horizontal surface, the }{\i\fs24 portable shadow}{\fs24 
 looks like any normal area of shade, as dark as a shadow cast by a tree or other solid object under a midday sun. This magical i
tem is useful for concealment and makes as good a hiding place as any naturally shaded area; rangers, thieves, and others have their normal chance of hiding in shadows when standing in a portable shadow. The shadow can be picked up by lifting the edge and
 folding it like a tablecloth.
\par \~\~\tab Dungeon Masters should use common sense adjudicating the use of a }{\i\fs24 portable shadow}{\fs24 . If a character attempts to use it to hide in shadow while crossing a featureless plain, the presence of a "black hole" attached to nothing w
ill be more likely to attract attention than to divert it. However, it can provide a shady place to cool off away from the desert sun.
\par 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Species Enemy Medallion (750 XP).}{\fs24  A character wears this copper disk on a chain around his neck and under his clothing 
so that the metal touches his chest. When the character comes within 100 yards of his species enemy, the medallion becomes warm, alerting him to the enemy's presence. The intensity of the warmth varies according to the number and proximity of the enemy. T
he medallion doesn't get hot enough to cause damage, nor does it reveal the exact location or number of enemies in the vicinity.
\par 
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 String Cage (500 XP). }{\fs24 This looks like a piece of white thread 20 feet long, flecked with gold. When arranged in a circle so that the ends touch, the }{\i\fs24 string cage}{\fs24 
 creates an invisible barrier that prevents any creature contained inside from leaving. The invisible barrier has the strength of a }{\i\fs24 wall of force}{\fs24  and has the shape of a closed cylinder about 6' tall. The }{\i\fs24 string cage}{\fs24 
 only
 functions if placed on the ground or other solid surface; if moved, the barrier dissipates. Because of its light weight, the string can't be thrown like a lasso; if rocks or other weights are attached, its magic is negated. Therefore, the device is mainl
y useful to contain creatures that are sleeping, trapped, restrained, or cooperative.
\par \~\~\tab A }{\i\fs24 string cage}{\fs24  can contain any single creature, so long as the creature fits inside the circle. Physical attacks and most spells have no effect on a string cage. The creature trapped inside can't move it. A }{\i\fs24 disintegrate
}{\fs24  spell destroys the device, as will a}{\i\fs24  rod of cancellation}{\fs24  or a }{\i\fs24 sphere of annihilation}{\fs24 . A creature contained in a string cage can escape by using dimension door, teleport, or a similar spell.
\par \~\~\tab Only the person who originally formed the circle can separate the ends and free the creature inside. Otherwise, a }{\i\fs24 string cage}{\fs24  lasts for 3-12 (3d4) hours, at which time the ends separate automatically. A}{\i\fs24  string cage}{
\fs24  can be used only once per day.
\par \~\~\tab 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Thorn of Sleep (100 XP each).}{\fs24  The }{\i\fs24 thorn of sleep}{\fs24 
 looks like the thorn of a plant, about three inches long. It is dry and smooth to the touch. If pricked by the thorn, a creature must make a saving throw vs. paralyzation. Failure means the creature falls into a deep slumber
. The creature will not waken until attacked or strongly roused. Noises, even those of battle, will not awaken the sleeping creature. Each thorn can be used but once. Only 1-8 thorns will be found at any one time. A }{\i\fs24 thorn of sleep}{\fs24 
 can be projected by a blowgun.
\par }{\b\fs32\cf13 
\par 
\par Chapter 7: Equipment
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab To help him thrive in a variety of environments, the ranger has developed a wide range of specialized equipment. This chapter describes some of the more useful items, along with some of the more unusual.
\par \~\~\tab Table 57 lists costs and weights of clothing, transport, and miscellaneous equipment. Table 58 provides similar information for weapons; see Chapter 6 of }{\i\fs24 the Player's Handbook}{\fs24 
 for the meaning of weapon size, speed factors, and type.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf13 Clothing
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Aba.}{\fs24  This desert robe is ma
de of lightweight fabric and covers the entire body. Typical colors include brown, gold, black, and white. Elaborate embroidery, made of brightly colored cloth strips or gold thread, often decorates the hem. A silken or cotton sash ties the aba at the wai
st.
\par \~\~\tab In deserts and other dry climates, such garments help prevent evaporation, allowing the wearer to retain more moisture and 
function more comfortably. Assuming adequate water, a character wearing a desert robe is no more likely to suffer heat exhaustion on days of extreme heat than a normal person would on days of moderate temperatures. Note that desert robes don't help in are
as of high humidity; in humid environments, as much skin should be exposed as possible to encourage cooling from the evaporation of perspiration.
\par 
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Arctic Coat.}{\fs24  Designed for protection against extreme cold, the arctic coat is a knee-length single-piece ga
rment with a billowing hood. The long sleeves allow the wearer to warm his hands by drawing them inside and holding them against his chest. Arctic coats are usually made of thick bear fur, lined with seal skin for comfort. An arctic coat keeps the wearer 
comfortable in temperatures well below zero degrees F.
\par 
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Rain Poncho.}{\fs24  A one-piece garment resembling a large cloak with a head-sized hole in the center, a poncho helps keep the wearer dry during rain storms. Ponchos are made of canvas or similar material,
 often treated with a waterproofing oil. A poncho can double as ground cover and can also be used as an emergency tent. Crude ponchos are sometimes woven from grass or reeds.
\par \~\~
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Snowshoes.}{\fs24  Each about three feet long, these oval-shaped wooden frames are la
ced with leather webbing to allow the wearer to walk across snow without sinking. A character newly introduced to wearing snowshoes moves at half his normal rate until he gets used to them. After a day or so of practice, he moves at his normal rate. A cha
racter wearing snowshoes receives no bonuses for charging.
\par 
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Terrain Suit.}{\fs24  Made of lightweight material, usually fine linen or silk, the terrain suit consists of a long-sleeved shirt or blouse and long trousers, dyed in various colors to help the wearer b
lend in with his surroundings. Styles include arctic (colored solid white), sand (mottled patches of various shades of brown, for desert and similarly sandy terrain), woodland (patterns of green and brown, for forests and jungles), and urban (black). A te
r
rain suit must be precisely made and fitted to the person to wear it. It is worn most commonly by Stalkers, though some individual tribes and groups of warriors, woodsmen, or thieves use them, too. (As a rule of thumb, terrain suits should be slightly mor
e common than elven chain mail.)
\par \~\~\tab A terrain suit gives the same advantages as the camouflage proficiency when worn in the appropriate terrain, using a base Wisdom rating of 14. A character wearing a terrain suit with the camouflage proficiency uses his Wi
sdom (or 14, whichever is higher) with an additional +1 bonus.
\par 
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Waterproof Boots.}{\fs24  These thick boots are made of tough, water-resilient hide (such as alligator or caribou) treated with a waterproofing oil (typically derived from seals or minks). The wear
er tucks his trousers inside the boots, then ties them near the knees with a leather drawstring. The boots keep the feet dry, even when wading in water.
\par 
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Wilderness Harness.}{\fs24  This device resembles a thick leather belt with straps that cross over the wear
er's back. Both the belt and the straps contain a series of small pouches, useful for storing supplies, ammunition for missile weapons, and other materials. A secret compartment in the back section of the belt conceals a 6-inch-long flat knife (the knife 
comes with the harness; see Table 58 for statistics).
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Transport
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Dog Sled. }{\fs24 One of the best ways to travel in snowy or icy terrain, a dog sled consists of a wooden frame for carrying supplies, wooden runners extending the length of the sled, a platform o
n which the passenger stands, and a lattice on the front to which the dog team is harnessed. About 6-11 dogs (or equivalent) can pull a sled 10 feet long and 3 feet wide, carrying up to 880 pounds (including the weight of the sled). Fewer animals are requ
ired for smaller sleds. A typical 8-dog sled travels at a movement rate of 15 with a load of about 680 lbs., including the sled.
\par \~\~\tab When adjudicating movement via dog sled, DMs should take into account that animals not bred or trained to pull a sled can cre
ate a considerable amount of trouble for the driver--tangling traces, fighting with nearby animals, and so on--and movement could be slower than expected.
\par \~\~
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Kayak.}{\fs24  This is a single-person boat, fast-moving and easy to maneuver. Its lashed wooden frame is
 about ten feet long and two feet wide, covered with canvas, sealskins, or hides of similar water-dwelling animals. The skins are attached to the frame, allowed to tighten by drying, then coated with oil to make the craft water resistant. The passenger sq
u
eezes into the hole in the top of the craft and sits so his legs extend into the bow. To seal out water, the opening of the kayak has an "apron" (often made of whale intestines) which the kayaker laces around his waist. He propels the kayak with a single 
long oar with a paddle on either end. A kayak can move 200'/round (its movement rate can be rounded down to 6) and it can carry 250 pounds.
\par \~\~
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Water Sled.}{\fs24  This resembles a dog sled with inflated skins in place of runners, enabling the craft to float on the
 surface of the water. Long leather reins, treated with waterproofing oil, connect with the animals pulling it, usually a team of eight seals or six dolphins. A water sled carries no more than two passengers (about 480 pounds, including the sled), unless 
the animals pulling it are exceptionally fast and strong. Made to ride as much above the water as in it, the sled can achieve a top movement rate of 15 if pulled by strong steeds, but 9-12 is a more sustainable speed.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf13 Miscellaneous Equipment
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Breathing Tube.}{\fs24 
 This simple device helps a character function underwater. A breathing tube made of a hollow reed, about a foot long, strengthened with wax and treated with waterproofing oil. The user places the tube in his mouth, then submerges himself with the end 
of the tube protruding from the water. The tube enables the submerged user to breathe indefinitely.
\par \~\~
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Camouflage Paint Kit.}{\fs24  This compact leather case contains several cakes of greasepaint (in various shades of brown, green, yellow, and black), applicator
 brushes, a jar of paint removal cream, and a small mirror. Characters apply the paint to areas of exposed flesh to help them blend in with their surroundings. A kit contains 12 uses.
\par \~\~\tab By itself, camouflage paint doesn't give a character any particular a
dvantage. However, when used with a terrain suit (described above), it boosts the character's success chances by +1. The camouflage proficiency is required to apply the camouflage paint well; those without this proficiency have }{\i\fs24 half}{\fs24 
 the usual chance of success. A character using camouflage paint and a terrain suit gains a +2 bonus to his camouflage check.
\par \~\~\tab 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Chain Leash.}{\fs24  Made of chain links with a leather muzzle, this leash can be adjusted to fit any animal ranging in size from a small dog to a wolf. The 
length of the leash varies from 6-12 feet long. When using a properly-fitted chain leash on an animal, a character receives a +1 bonus to his animal training proficiency checks. Chain leashes are available in other sizes and lengths to fit larger and smal
ler animals.
\par \~\~
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Falconry Gauntlet.}{\fs24  Also called a perch glove, this is a heavy arm-length glove of thick leather upon which a falcon or hawk can perch.
\par \~\~\tab 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Falcon Training Equipment.}{\fs24  This equipment makes falcon training more efficient. A character using th
e falconry proficiency without this equipment suffers a -2 penalty to training proficiency checks. One set is required for each falcon.
\par \~\~\tab 
\par \tab Each set consists of }{\i\fs24 jesses}{\fs24  (leather bands with rings, attached to the falcon's legs), }{\i\fs24 talon guards}{\fs24  (metal coverings for the bird-s claws to prevent it from harming the owner during training), a }{\i\fs24 creance}{
\fs24  (a slender leather leash attached to the jesses, held by the user or secured to the perch glove), and a }{\i\fs24 hood}{\fs24  (a leather covering fitting over the falcon-s head that res
tricts vision; the hood forces the falcon to rely on its senses of hearing, touch, and taste). Customized or richly appointed equipment, such as an embroidered hood or golden jesses, is also available, usually at double or triple the normal price.
\par \~\~
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Fishing Tackle.}{\fs24 
 This meticulously crafted set of polished wooden lures, colorful flies made of feathers and catgut cord, bone hooks, and cork bobbers can be quite useful in the hands of a skilled fisherman. If used by a character with the fishing proficiency, 
the proficiency checks are modified by +1.
\par \~\~}{\b\fs24 
\par \tab Healing Kit.}{\fs24  This is a waterproofed leather or canvas backpack or handbag containing cloth bandages, splints, needles and thread (for stitching wounds), ointments, and a selection of herbs for soothing pain (t
hese don't heal damage). It also has room for special medicines, such as poison antidotes or healing potions, but these are not included in the standard kit. The kit is useful in treating injuries of all types; a character with the healing or veterinary h
ealing proficiency without this kit or equivalent may not be able to use the proficiency, depending on the situation.
\par \~\~\tab 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Insect Repellent.}{\fs24  Applying this rare, minty cream over a character's face, arms, and other areas of exposed flesh repels bees, ants, a
nd all other types of insects less than 1 Hit Die in size. One application wears off after 8 hours. A jar of insect repellent contains 12 applications.
\par \~\~
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Scent Lure.}{\fs24  A scent lure is a pungent liquid used to attract animals in the wild. Each scent lure at
tracts a specific type of animal, usually woodland game such as deer, wolf, or fox; individual animals of the species find the odor irresistible.
\par \~\~\tab Each bottle of scent lure contains five applications. One application near a tree, rock, or snare has a 15%
 chance of attracting an animal of the given species within 24 hours, presuming the animal passes within 100 yards of the application (the DM determines if an animal comes close enough). Extra applications do not increase the chance of attraction. The sce
nt evaporates in 24 hours.
\par \~\~\tab 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Sleeping Bag.}{\fs24  More comfortable, but bulkier than blankets, the sleeping bag is made of two layers of canvas or wool, stuffed with down for warmth. The user slips inside the sleeping bag and secures the open side by fastening 
several buckles or tying a series of leather straps.
\par \~\~\tab 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Sun Goggles.}{\fs24  Arctic or mountaineering sun goggles are made from solid wood. The wearer peers through two narrow slits. These reduce or eliminate the effects of dazzling lights, such as fatigue from 
traveling under very bright sun (for example, across deserts, or flat plains on cloudless days). Sun goggles also prevent snowblindness, where the eyes become swollen from exposure to bright sun reflecting off ice and snow. (Attack penalties for snowblind
ness vary from -1 to -4.)
\par \~\~\tab 
\par \tab Sun goggles will not prevent blindness caused when a }{\i\fs24 light}{\fs24  spell is cast directly against the wearer's eyes. Sun goggles also reduce the field of vision; the wearer can't see above or below without moving his head. This may inc
rease chances of being surprised or attacked from a blind side, at the DM's option.
\par \~\~
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Sunburn Ointment.}{\fs24  Characters risk damage from sunburn in any terrain during seasons of bright sunlight, not only in deserts, but also in the arctic, where the sun refle
cts off the ice and snow. If characters don't protect exposed flesh with scarves, mask, or other covering, they risk suffering 1 point of damage from sunburn per day. An application of sunburn ointment, gives protection against sunburn for a full day. A j
ar of sunburn ointment contains 14 applications.
\par \~\~\tab Sunburn ointment gives no protection from magical or non-magical fire; it is ineffective against any source of damage other than the sun.
\par \~\~\tab Sunburn ointment is rare, found only in the best-stocked shops in large cities.
\par \~\~\tab 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Survival Kit.}{\fs24  A character may strap this small leather pouch, about four inches on each side and an inch thick, around his thigh, upper arm, or anywhere else where it can 
remain concealed. The kit contains a number of small items useful in emergencies: a scrap of parchment and piece of graphite (for writing messages), a fish hook, a 25-foot length of fishing line on a spool, one gold piece (good for bribing guards), a smal
l
 razor (for severing rope or inflicting 1 hit point of damage against captors), a wooden whistle (for signaling), a cloth pad (for making an emergency bandage), and a few pieces of sugar candy and dried fruit (for quick energy, or luring animals). Similar
 items may be substituted to customize individual kits.
\par \~\~
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Tents.}{\fs24  These portable shelters, usually made of canvas or tanned animal skin, provide shelter from the elements for weary travelers. They're easy to erect and light to carry. Here a few of the most
 popular small tents, suitable for one or two occupants:
\par {\pntext\pard\plain\f3 \loch\af3\dbch\af0\hich\f3 \'b7\tab}}\pard \fi-360\li720\nowidctlpar\tx0\tx360{\*\pn \pnlvlblt\ilvl0\ls1\pnrnot0\pnf3\pnindent360 {\pntxtb \'b7}}\ls1\adjustright {\i\fs24 Bell Tent.}{\fs24 
 This is one of the simplest tents, consisting of a single sheet of fabric arranged around a pole to form a cone. Ropes attached to stakes surrounding the bottom of the tent are pulled t
o stretch the fabric tight. Though quick to construct and easy to transport, bell tents don't provide much protection against strong winds.

 Also known as an A-frame tent or a wall tent, the wedge tent is built on a frame consisting of two ve
rtical poles with a horizontal pole secured between them. The fabric is laid across the horizontal pole, then stretched with ropes attached to stakes. The wedge tent is somewhat sturdier than the bell tent, although like that tent, it provides only modest
 protection against severe weather.

 Combining elements of both the bell and wedge tents, the pyramid tent frame is made of four vertical poles arranged in a square, with horizontal poles attached between them. A longer pole rises from the c
enter of the square. The fabric extends from the center pole to form four slanting walls, secured with stakes. The sturdy pyramid tent resists light to moderate winds.

 Particularly useful in cold climates, the bundle tent consists of from s
ix to eight ribs about five feet long, connected to each other by the tent covering. The covering consists of two layers of skin from a furry animal, such as a bear or caribou. The layers are arranged fur-side out, creating a pocket of air for extra insul
ation. The tent opens like an umbrella to form a domed shape or folds into a bundle.

\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Tinderbox, Waterproof.}{\fs24  This waterproof box contains flint and steel, along wit
h a small supply of wood shavings for kindling. The box keeps the contents dry during a rainstorm or when submerged underwater. Once per round, a character can attempt to start a fire using these materials. A roll of 1 or 2 on a 1d8 is necessary to start 
a fire in normal, dry conditions. A 1 on a 1d8 is necessary if the area is damp; the DM may require more difficult rolls (for instance, a 1 on 1d12) in wet terrain, or may rule that a fire can't be started at all.

ply this oily paste to their weapons or armor, it makes the metallic surfaces non-reflective and nearly invisible. Modify their base chance to hide in shadows by +5%. A coat of weaponblack lasts until the character engages in melee combat, at which time e
nough of the substance flakes away to negate any camouflaging advantage. The substance is flammable; if lighted, a sword coated with the paste will become the equivalent of a }{\i\fs24 flametongue}{\fs24 
 for 2-5 rounds, and will also inflict 1d4 points of heat damage upon the wielder unless he is magically protected. A vial of weaponblack contains 1 application. This substance is uncommon and only available through shady under-the-counter dealing.

\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Weapons
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Flail, Grain.}{\fs24  This consists of a leather strap two or three feet 
long that connects a wooden handle to a block of wood about a foot long. Farmers use the grain flail to thresh wheat, barley, and other grassy crops. It also makes a good bludgeoning weapon.
\par \~\~\tab 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Hatchet.}{\fs24  This one-handed woodsman's axe has a broad blade, a
 smooth wooden handle for a good grip, and its own leather scabbard for the head, which can be strapped to the wearer's belt. The hatchet is useful for chopping wood and serves as an excellent melee weapon.
\par \~\~\tab 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Ice Pick.}{\fs24  This special type of metal awl is 
used to break holes in frozen lakes for ice fishing and to chip away ice chunks when building snow houses. (Note, however, that the snow blade, or iuak, described below, is the primary tool for such a job.) Consisting of a bone or wood handle and a sharp 
metal point about six inches long, an ice pick also can be used as an impaling weapon.
\par \~\~\tab 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Snow Blade.}{\fs24  Also called an }{\i\fs24 iuak}{\fs24 , the snow blade resembles a machete made of bone, about two feet long and six inches wide.
 The end is flat rather than pointed. Mainly used by arctic rangers to slice blocks of snow to make shelters, the snow blade also doubles as a weapon.
\par \~}{\b\fs24 \~\tab 
\par \tab Machete.}{\fs24  Farmers in tropical regions use this 3-foot-long flat blade to chop cane and clear undergrowth. Wielded like a sword, it can inflict serious damage. The price of a machete includes a canvas sheath.
\par \~\~\tab 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Ritiik.}{\fs24  This 6-foot-long weapon consists of a wooden shaft with a point and a hook on the same end. Primarily used by primitive tribes of arctic
 and tundra regions for hunting bear and other large game, the ritiik is thrust, not thrown. When the point pierces the animal, the user jerks and twists the shaft to embed the hook.
\par \~\~
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Scythe.}{\fs24  A curved blade attached to a 5-foot wooden pole, this farm to
ol is used to cut grain at harvest and also doubles as a weapon. A user wields the scythe by holding the short wooden bars on the end opposite the blade. The scythe is always used as a two-handed weapon.

\par Chapter 8: Role-Playing}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab Each ranger is a unique individual with his own feelings, motivations, and personal history. Because there are an endless number of possibilities for ranger pe
rsonalities, step-by-step guidelines for generating them are not practical, nor are they particularly desirable. Strong characters have constantly evolving personalities, reflecting their experiences as well as their players' inclinations. Just about anyt
hing goes, so long as the DM approves and the resulting character is fun to play.
\par \~\~\tab Look over the topics in this chapter and consider how they relate to your character. Ask yourself how he become a ranger in the first place. Where does he come from? What d
rives him? What makes him feel angry, happy, fulfilled? How does he spend his free time? As you answer these and other questions, your mental image of the character should begin to sharpen. Before you know it, he'll be as familiar as an old friend.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Demographics
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab The total number of rangers is difficult to determine. Because of their independent nature and tendency to avoid civilized society, rangers aren't likely to cooperate with a formal census. Additionally, many rangers reside in the most remo
te regions of the world, making a population count impractical if not impossible.
\par \~\~\tab Still, it's safe to say that rangers are among the less numerous of the character classes, if for no other reason than the demanding ability score requirements limit their
 number. It's a good bet that there are fewer rangers than bards. They're perhaps more common than paladins. Beyond these generalities, it's anybody's guess.
\par \~\~\tab Terrain preferences are a little easier to ascertain. Most rangers prefer forests, hills, and p
lains, thanks to the flourishing animal life and comfortable climates. Rugged mountains, and jungles attract the more adventurous rangers, while only the hardiest rangers make their home in the harsh lands of the desert and arctic. As a rough guideline, a
ssume that about 40% of all rangers have Forest as their primary terrain, about 15% have Hill, another 10% or so each have Jungle, Mountain, or Plain, and the rest are more or less equally divided among Swamp,  Desert, Arctic, and Aquatic.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Race
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab Unless 
the demi-rangers described in Chapter 4 are allowed in your campaign, rangers must be human, elf, or half-elf. Roughly 70% of all rangers are human, 10% are elves, and 20% are half-elves. Even in demi-ranger campaigns, less than 1% of the ranger populatio
n are dwarves, gnomes, or halflings.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Gender
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab Gender plays no part in determining one's aptitude for becoming a ranger. About half the ranger population is male, and the other half, female, reflecting the percentages in the general population.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Social Background}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \~\tab \~No particular social background predominates in the ranger population. Lower, middle, and upper class rangers are more or less equally represented, with a slight bias toward the lower classes at low levels because these are closest to the land.

\par \~\~\tab 
Certain kits also tend to favor certain social classes. Feralans and Greenwood Rangers tend to come from lower economic backgrounds, while Falconers, Sea Rangers, and Wardens often come from wealthier families. Social class, however, is only one eleme
nt that influences a ranger's personality. A Guardian with a lower class background who has worked his way up might behave little differently than one with middle class origins.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Family
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab More relevant to the ranger's choice of career is the size of his 
family and his role within it. Because his duties place him into a life of relative isolation, the best candidates for rangers are those with few family ties. Orphans and late children are disproportionately represented in the ranger population, as are th
ose who have been disowned or cast out by their families.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Age
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab There are no rigid age requirements for rangers. However, few adolescents are capable of commanding the respect due a ranger, while many older individuals have trouble managing the rigors of
 the wild. Consequently, the majority of rangers fall between the ages of 18-60.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Alignment
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab 
All rangers are of good alignment, and the number of lawful good, neutral good, and chaotic good rangers are approximately equal. The more independent and isolated a ranger, the less likely he'll be lawful good. Lawful good rangers are often drawn to the 
Guardian, Justifier, and Warden kits. The Pathfinder and Explorer kits tend to have more than their share of neutral good rangers. Chaotic good rangers are generally associated with the Feralan and Mountain Man kits.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf13 Becoming a Ranger}{\b\fs24\cf13 
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab Unlike many other
 character classes, rangers have no clear career paths. Wizards may be taught in magic academies and clerics may be recruited by a church, but no structured training centers exist for rangers. There are guilds for thieves and worldwide hierarchies for dru
i
ds, but rangers stubbornly resist organizations of any kind. Since the ranger class stresses self-reliance and independence, it's not surprising that the circumstances under which they acquire their skills are as varied as the rangers themselves. Here are
 some of the most common ways to become a ranger, along with a few kits typically associated with them. Of course, the standard ranger might have any of these.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Apprenticeship
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab An elderly ranger may wish to make sure that his territory will be in good ha
nds after his death. Rather than award conservatorship of the territory to another ranger or a local government, he may instead decide to recruit an apprentice. The elder not only teaches the ways of the wilderness to the young man or woman, but also pass
es along his values, ensuring that his philosophy will live on. Friends or family members of the elder make ideal candidates for apprentices, as do orphans and human followers.
\par \~\~}{\i\fs24 \tab Suggested Kits:}{\fs24  Falconer, Forest Runner, Greenwood Ranger, Guardian, Pathfinder, Sea Ranger, Seeker.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Self-Determination
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab Individuals attracted to this character class may take it upon themselves to master the necessary skills without a formal apprenticeship. Such an individual may be motivated by curiosity (he's fascinated by n
ature and longs to learn what books can't teach), a compelling event (an army of orcs makes a surprise attack against his village from an unpatrolled forest; he vows to guard the forest to prevent a recurrence), or a restless urge to explore the world (he
 feels smothered by the secure but boring life his parents have planned for him).
\par \~\~\tab A self-determined ranger often takes a circuitous route to learning his craft. He may begin by petitioning his lord or king to allow him to accompany military personnel on 
wilderness excursions, learning from observation how soldiers survive in the field and track their enemies. He may offer to keep house or work for a sage or hedge wizard in exchange for private lessons in botany and other natural sciences. A few years as 
a neophyte in a nature-oriented church may give him access to priestly magic. And a surreptitious partnership or adoption by a notorious thief may teach him the knack of hiding in shadows and moving silently.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Suggested Kits:}{\fs24  Explorer, Forest Runner, Guardian, Justifier, Pathfinder, Sea Ranger, Seeker, Stalker.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Conscription
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab Occasionally, a king or other official requires a ranger to explore, settle, or administer
 a recently annexed territory. A replacement may be needed for a ranger who has retired or died. If a suitable candidate isn't available, the most suitable young man or woman may be drafted. Generous authorities may reward the draftee's family with a mont
h
ly stipend in exchange for the cooperation of their son or daughter. More often, however, the authorities offer no remuneration, expecting some type of service from all citizens; recruitment as a ranger is generally preferable to the risky life of a soldi
er or dull routine of a bureaucrat.
\par \~\~\tab Conscripted rangers often receive first-class training, perhaps at the hands of elder or retired rangers. Some countries have special units of border runners or scouts, which can provide a training ground for the poten
tial ranger. Terms of services range from several years in most cases to a few decades in extremely militaristic societies. Though many choose to re-enlist when their service terms expire, most conscripted rangers eventually part company with the establis
hed rulers and continue their careers as free agents.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Suggested Kits:}{\fs24  Justifier, Giant Killer, Pathfinder, Sea Ranger, Warden, Stalker.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Happenstance
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab A common way for a young character to become a ranger is though circumstances beyond his control. Th
e following are typical. A youth who makes his way to an uninhabited island after his ship sinks has to master the skills of a ranger in order to survive. The lone survivor of a pioneer family slaughtered by grizzly bears wanders for years in the wilderne
s
s, becoming a ranger in the process. A youth captured by slavers escapes into the wilderness and eventually learns ranger skills. He returns much later as an accomplished ranger with a mission to destroy or drive out the band of slavers who imprisoned him
.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Suggested Kits:}{\fs24  Beastmaster, Explorer, Feralan, Guardian, Mountain Man, Pathfinder.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Divine Intervention}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \~\~\tab For purposes of their own, the gods may choose a mortal to receive the skills of a ranger. If the gods see a need for a protector of a favored 
tract of land, or desire an advocate for threatened animals, they may seek out a youth with the prerequisite physical skills, mental agility, and moral attitude. If the youth is open to their offer--generally, the gods won't bother with an unreceptive can
didate--he will be guided through a lengthy series of quests and training exercises to develop the skills necessary to become a ranger. In some cases, the gods may grant him the skills directly.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Suggested Kits:}{\fs24  Beastmaster, Greenwood Ranger, Guardian, Justifier, Mountain Man, Sea Ranger, Seeker.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Social Misfit
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab Society has no use for some of its citizens, shunning them because of their appearance, race, social standing, or nonconformist philosophies. Outcast youths often find solace in the wilderness. 
Animals, they discover, are far less judgmental than humans. In time, those with strong wills and a knack for survival may become rangers through sheer tenacity.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Suggested Kits:}{\fs24  Feralan, Greenwood Ranger, Guardian, Mountain Man, Stalker.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf13 Common Traits: the Classic Ranger
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab Perhaps the most important aspect of creating a three-dimensional character is determining his core traits, the values and principles upon which he bases his philosophy. A character with specific values tends to be more consistent i
n his reactions. And while few real-world people are wholly consistent, the more consistently a character behaves, the more lifelike he'll appear in the context of a game.
\par \~\~\tab While no two rangers are exactly alike in their outlook, all share a set of commo
n traits which form the foundation of their personality. These traits are described in general terms below, and are not intended to straitjacket a good role-player. A player doesn't necessarily have to incorporate all of these traits into his character, b
ut he should think carefully before setting them aside. In a sense, these traits are as crucial to defining the ranger character class as his ability scores.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Strong Ethics
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab Rangers have firm values that impel them to promote goodness and justice. Regard
less of whether he's lawful good, neutral good, or chaotic good, a ranger has definite ideas about the difference between right and wrong. He behaves honestly, and most rangers believe in altruism and service. Selfishness and greed are antithetical to the
 
ranger. He champions the powerless and fights for the weak. In many cases, a ranger's respect for life extends to animals as well as humans. Though in essence rangers are warriors, most have no fondness for war. Even when fighting for a cause in which he 
believes, the ranger looks forward to the end of the conflict and the natural healing process promised by peace.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Love of Nature
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab A ranger is as much a creature of the wilderness as a lion or wild horse. Many rangers find urban life suffocating and would
 no more make their homes in a city than volunteer for a prison sentence. A typical ranger prefers songbirds to orchestras, flowers to jewelry, and forests to grand castles. Most rangers are sophisticated enough to handle themselves well in urban settings
, but they generally can't wait to finish their business and leave.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Solitary
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab By virtue of his duties and disposition, the ranger spends a lot of time alone. Most rangers come to enjoy the solitary life, and have no particular need for the company of ot
her people. In most cases, animals satisfy a ranger's desire for companionship.
\par \~\~On the positive side, the ranger's penchant for solitude encourages him to be self-reliant and independent. On the negative side, rangers may come across as remote and detach
ed, even antisocial. While a ranger may be perfectly capable of social etiquette, his companions may believe that he's not especially interested in fostering lasting friendships.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Taciturn
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab By observing wild animals, many rangers have learned the import
ance of keeping their emotions in check. A juvenile wolf who charges impulsively is certain to scare away his prey. A young lioness who makes unprovoked, pointless attacks against the pride leader may find herself ostracized and alone. Consequently, range
r
s often conceal their feelings from friends and strangers alike, revealing little about themselves in actions or words. For all but the ranger's closest companions, it's often difficult to tell if he's happy or sad, angry or forgiving, troubled or content
.
\par \~\~\tab 
Though rangers certainly experience emotions as deeply as anyone else, many suffer in silence when wounded, and grieve in private at the loss of a beloved animal or comrade. A ranger's companions invariably find him to be a dependable, competent, and t
rustworthy professional. But as a person, he often remains an impenetrable enigma.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Devout
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab Many rangers are deeply and privately spiritual, perceiving their access to spells and their appreciation of nature as gifts from a greater power. Whether a rang
er worships nature itself as a unifying force or follows an established religion, he combines his love of nature with his faith to form the foundation of his moral code. Such rangers regularly reaffirm their commitment through moments of quiet reflection.
 (See Chapter 9 for more about rangers and religion.)
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf13 Daily Life
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab When a ranger is not adventuring, he still has plenty to do to keep busy. Some of the more common ranger activities are described below.
\par \~\~\tab Most of a ranger's daily routine occurs off sta
ge; that is, neither the player nor the DM need keep a detailed record of what a ranger does between adventures. However, a creative DM may use elements of a ranger's routine as the basis for an adventure--while patrolling his territory, a ranger intercep
t
s a goblin who turns out to be a scout for an advancing army; or as a springboard for a ranger to acquire a new follower--a bear rescued from poachers takes a liking to the ranger. A ranger's routine might also generate encounters to introduce him to impo
rtant NPCs--the ranger provides first aid to a hunter who turns out to be a powerful official in a prosperous kingdom; or gain him experience--the ranger earns experience points by fighting a small forest fire.
\par \~\~\tab Of course, not every ranger regularly engag
es in all of these activities. A ranger occupying an arctic territory doesn't have to worry much about forest fires, while a Warden probably spends more of his time enforcing laws than a Greenwood Ranger or Feralan. Still, the activities described here sh
ould give you a good idea of how a typical ranger fills his day.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Patrolling
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab The ranger spends much of his free time patrolling his territory. He may follow the same route every day, or he may wander wherever his fancy takes him. He keeps an eye out for
 signs of trouble, such as eroded fields or withered plants, and makes contact with other sentient residents, listening to their problems or engaging in small talk. Some rangers ride mounts, particularly if they have a lot of ground to cover, but most pre
f
er to patrol on foot, which enables them to traverse obstacles more easily, as well as minimizing the chance of drawing attention to themselves. Though patrolling is necessary to keep abreast of the condition of their territories, rangers also patrol for 
the sheer pleasure of basking in the open air and savoring nature's splendor.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Monitoring Strangers
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab A ranger is ever-watchful for strangers in his territory. Followers or other contacts may alert him to the presence of strangers, or he may become aware of them himself by noticing disturbances in the terrain or observing them directly.
\par \~\~\tab In most cases, a ranger monitors strangers discretely, watching them from the cover of trees or shadows, or requesting his followers to make regular reports of their act
ivities. Usually, a ranger can ascertain the intention of strangers without ever making direct contact with them. Most turn out to be harmless travelers or hunters who pose no threat to the ranger or his territory, and the ranger leaves them alone.
\par \~\~\tab If a
 stranger's motives are more ambiguous--for instance, if he's chopping down trees or hunting animals beyond his needs--the ranger will confront him, politely but firmly inquiring about his intentions. Generally, the abrupt appearance of an intimidating ra
n
ger, particularly if he's accompanied by a bear or two, elicits immediate cooperation. If the stranger explains himself satisfactorily, the ranger departs, perhaps implying that he'll be back if the stranger doesn't keep his nose clean. Should the strange
r resist the ranger's authority, the ranger may take whatever actions he deems necessary to ensure compliance, using violence as a last resort.
\par \~\~\tab However, physical confrontations are rare. More commonly, strangers require directions, medical care, or advic
e. A ranger is usually willing to help, especially if his assistance facilitates their leaving his territory more quickly. If the strangers are lost, the ranger will point out the best route leading to their desired destination. In some cases, he'll volun
t
eer to guide them. Most rangers have a rudimentary knowledge of first aid, and can bind sprained ankles, splint bones, and attempt to resuscitate for drowning victims. A ranger can explain which plants are edible and which are poisonous. He can direct str
angers to sources of fresh water, orchards of ripe fruit, and safe campsites.
\par \~\~\tab In return, the ranger may well insist that strangers clean up after themselves, avoid disturbing local habitats, and preserve the natural beauty of the environment. Those who v
iolate the ranger's trust can expect a brisk escort out of his territory.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Trailblazing
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab A ranger who occupies an undeveloped wilderness must spend a fair amount of time making and maintaining trails. Some of these trails may be permanent roads or paths
, usable by anyone traversing the ranger's territory. Other trails may be known only to the ranger, concealed by dense woods or similar terrain. The ranger and his followers use these concealed trails to get from place to place while monitoring the moveme
nt of strangers. Although animals in their native habitats are efficient trailmakers, the ranger may improve their trails by making the footing safer, or linking feeding grounds, watering holes, grazing pastures, and lairs.
\par \~\~\tab An effective trail system requ
ires a thorough understanding of the land, including the precise location of streams, hills, and other significant terrain features. A ranger occupying a small territory may be able to hold this information in his head. For larger regions, the ranger may 
need to keep maps. In this case, a conscientious ranger will regularly review and update his maps, adding new features and looking for discrepancies.
\par \~\~\tab Constructing a new trail begins with clearing debris and smoothing the ground. This may involve cutting 
trees, pulling stumps, and filling in holes. If a road passes though a valley or ravine, the ranger may have to dig ditches to direct rainwater away from the trail. He may then need to plant grasses along the roadside to prevent soil from washing into the
 ditches.
\par \~\~\tab Trail maintenance is an ongoing chore, requiring weeding in the spring and ice removal in the winter. In exceptionally harsh climates, the ranger may have to build snow fences, which are constructions of wood or stone that run parallel to a tra
il. During blizzards, blowing snow piles up along the fence instead of covering the trail.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Wildlife Management}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \~\~\tab A dutiful ranger looks after the interests of the wildlife in his territory. He tracks down poachers and unprincipled hunters, relocates cre
atures that have been displaced by natural disasters, and cares for young animals whose parents have been killed. He notes fluctuations in animal populations and tries to determine if an excess of predators (or prey) is only a temporary adjustment to curr
ent conditions, or if it foreshadows a more serious problem. A sudden drop in the number of songbirds or frogs, for instance, may indicate that the insects they eat have been poisoned by some outside source.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Conservation
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab A ranger is dedicated to the pr
eservation of his environment. He uses timber, water, and other natural resources judiciously and encourages others to do the same. If he cuts a tree, he replaces it with a new seedling. If he raises herd animals, he keeps them moving so as not to overgra
ze a pasture. If he farms, he rotates his crops so as not to exhaust the soil, replacing the nutrients with natural fertilizers.
\par \~\~\tab Unfortunately, the ranger must continually struggle against the carelessness and greed of those who don't share his concerns.
 They strip the land of timber and minerals, and level entire forests to build new cities. For commerce or sport, they hunt scarce species to extinction. They relentlessly farm the same acreage until the soil can no longer support crops, and dump raw sewa
ge and other waste products into lakes and rivers until the water is no longer fit to drink.
\par \~\~\tab The ranger employs several methods to counter this selfishness and indifference. He educates travelers passing through his territory, demonstrating the importanc
e of proper waste disposal and the danger of smoldering camp fires. He negotiates with local villages to regulate mining and farming, and to set aside virgin forests and jungles as protected sanctuaries. In extreme situations, a ranger may resort to gueri
lla tactics, such as sabotaging oppressive and ruinous activities.
\par \~\~\tab A ranger must also be constantly vigilant for natural disasters. As prevention is the key to effective disaster management, a ranger remains alert for the earliest signs of trouble, takin
g immediate steps to intervene before the problem becomes a full-blown catastrophe.
\par \~\~\tab Here are some the most common natural disasters a ranger might have to face:
\par \~\tab }{\b\fs24 Insects/Disease.}{\fs24  Infestations of beetles, locusts, aphids, and other insects can strip for
ests and pastures in a matter of days or weeks. Molds and rusts can ravage woodlands if unchecked. Old trees, which aren't as resistant to disease as younger ones, are particularly vulnerable. To prevent the spread of destructive insects and fungi, ranger
s remove and dispose of infested plants as quickly as possible.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Flood.}{\fs24  An excess of precipitation, sudden snowmelt, or high winds producing strong coastal waves may result in flooding. Floods can wash away valuable topsoil, destroy trees and buildings, a
nd drown the unprepared. Rangers reduce the severity of river flooding by planting and maintaining the trees and grasses in elevated lands. This vegetation controls runoff and absorbs melted snow, preventing it from running off into rivers and causing the
 
water to rise over the embankments. Ambitious rangers with leadership skills will sometimes coordinate the local population to assist him building levees to contain rivers prone to flooding. This must be handled with care, as such rivers can silt up, caus
ing worse problems later.
\par \~\~\tab Seacoast floods, on the other hand, are almost impossible to prevent. A ranger's best strategy for dealing with them is to become familiar with the weather patterns that precede them. With sufficient warning, a ranger can warn o
thers to seek protection in the highlands until the storm subsides.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Earthquake.}{\fs24  Violent shifting of the earth's inner layers may produce earthquakes, which can occur anywhere in the world. Earthquakes can indirectly cause flooding and fires, but the big
gest danger comes from avalanches, falling rocks, trees, mudslides, and collapsing buildings.
\par \~\~\tab As with seacoast floods, there's not much a ranger can do to prevent earthquakes, but he can learn to recognize the signs that precede them. Unusual animal beh
avior (such as the agitated prancing of small mammals), spontaneous geyser eruptions, and clusters of small tremors often indicate an impending major earthquake. While the warnings may not come long in advance, a forewarned ranger can spread the word to h
ead for plains or open fields, which may be safer havens in the event of a major earthquake.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Drought.}{\fs24  Higher than average temperatures and a lack of rainfall may result in a drought. When water is scarce, rivers dry up, vegetation withers, and animals suffer from dehydration.
\par \~\~\tab Rangers can't accurately predict when droughts will occur. However, in regions of irregular rainfall, he can check tree rings, which give an excellent indicator of rain received in previous seasons. Thick rings occur in wet years,
 thin rings in dry years. Since wet periods tend to alternate with dry periods, studying the rings can help the ranger anticipate the next drought. A ranger can't offset the overall effects of a drought, but he can reduce the local impact of the drought o
n marginal habitats by storing water, and encouraging others to do the same.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Fire.}{\fs24  Fires are perhaps the most devastating of all natural disasters. A fire not only wipes out trees and vegetation, it also kills animals and pollutes lakes and rivers with a
sh. Travelers who carelessly burn trash or toss unwanted torches into the brush are a common source of fires. While lightning strikes are a primary cause of forest fires, some fires are intentionally set by enemies.
\par \~\~\tab Rangers occupying forests or other te
rritories susceptible to fire constantly watch for smoke. Tall mountains make the best vantage point, but where mountains are unavailable or where scaling them frequently is impractical, rangers may construct lookout towers--simple platforms supported by 
long poles and nearby trees. A rope or wood ladder gives the ranger access to the tower.
\par \~\~\tab Fighting fires isn't easy, nor is it something one ranger can effectively do alone. Because fires spread so rapidly, particularly in dry seasons, a ranger's chance o
f stopping a fire decreases with every moment it's allowed to burn. Water or dirt can be used to smother small fires. If a ranger has prepared for help beforehand, he can coordinate the building of a fireline--an area cleared of all vegetation and other c
o
mbustible material. This helps contain larger fires, but an adequate fireline usually requires the efforts of many individuals working as a team. Once a fire is extinguished, a close watch must still be kept for many days, lest a smoldering limb start the
 fire blazing once again.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Law Enforcement
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab Certain rangers, such as Wardens and Sea Rangers, may be charged with enforcing the laws of the local ruler. They arrest and punish poachers, patrol the lands they guard, and sometimes negotiate land use agreem
ents with farmers, loggers, and others. If a royal decree protects a particular animal species, the ranger may be charged with enforcing it. Some rangers have the authority to act as judge and jury, allowing them to try cases on the spot and pass sentence
s
 as they see fit. Fines may be levied for minor infractions, such as trespassing, while more severe crimes, such as killing an animal from the king=s private stock or picking fruit from the king's tree, may be punishable by death. In such cases, the range
r will have a charter or royal writ from the ruler.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf13 The Ranger's Personality
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab After considering the ranger's background, core traits, and routine duties, let's focus on his personality. The purpose of this section is to help players and DMs determine ho
w ranger characters may behave in a campaign--for instance, how he responds to NPCs, interacts with other PCs, and reacts in combat situations. There are several courses to consider.
\par \~\~\tab To begin with, you can consult the previous volumes in the }{\i\fs24 Complete Handbook}{\fs24  series. The first four books }{\i\fs24 The Complete Warrior, Priest, Wizard}{\fs24 , and }{\i\fs24 Thief}{\fs24 
 provide lists of archetypes drawn from literature, film, and other fictional and mythological sources. In these books, players are encouraged to adopt the Folk Hero, the Vi
gilante, or other archetypes as models for their characters' personalities. Many of these archetypes can also be adapted to ranger characters; the archetypes in }{\i\fs24 The Complete Fighter's Handbook}{\fs24  are especially applicable.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 The Complete Bard's Handbook}{\fs24  feat
ures a series of tables containing traits associated with intellect, interests, and other personality components. The key traits listed on these tables can be picked or determined randomly. The tables can be used for rangers as well as bards (or for that 
matter, any other character).
\par \~\~\tab You can also refer to the kit descriptions in Chapter 4 of this book, many of which suggest traits associated with a particular ranger type. Players can use the descriptions as springboards for working out the details of the
ir rangers' personalties.
\par \~\~\tab Another way to shape a character's personality is to come up with a single word that summarizes his identity. This word--which we'll call the }{\i\fs24 defining characteristic}{\fs24 --describes the essential nature of the character and how he c
omes across to others. While a character's personality is comprised of many elements, the defining characteristic is the most dominant, the trait from which all other personality components arise.
\par \~\~\tab If basing a personality on a single word seems restrictive or artificial, think about how you describe people in your own life. A particular teacher may be }{\i\fs24 crabby}{\fs24 , a close friend may be }{\i\fs24 funny}{\fs24 
, a favorite game designer may be }{\i\fs24 eccentric}{\fs24 . Defining characteristics may also spring to mind for fictional characters; consider the }{\i\fs24 noble}{\fs24  Sir Galahad, the }{\i\fs24 brilliant }{\fs24 Sherlock Holmes, the }{\i\fs24 
stingy}{\fs24  Ebenezer Scrooge. The defining characteristic forms an overall impression. The details come afterwards.
\par \~\~\tab There's no best method for choosing a defining characteristic. Whatever word
 seems appropriate to you is good enough, so long as it brings the character into focus and feels right. To get you started, a sample list of defining characteristics appropriate for rangers is given below. The descriptions are intentionally vague, since 
personal interpretations are more important than rigid definitions. After all, it's }{\i\fs24 your}{\fs24  character!
\par \~\~\tab You'll know if you've chosen a good defining characteristic if you can immediately begin to visualize how the ranger will respond in various situations. For instance, an }{\i\fs24 arrogant}{\fs24 
 ranger may enter a deserted castle without hesitation, certain that he can contend with whatever dangers wait inside. In combat, he may fight aggressively and enthusiastically, each blow accompanied by a declaration of his own magn
ificence. If defeated, the arrogant ranger may sulk for days, his ego taking longer to heal than his fleshly wounds. Of course, it's not necessary to think through every situation before it occurs--having your character react spontaneously is a big part o
f what makes role-playing fun--but deciding on a primary characteristic can be a lot of help in getting him off the ground.
\par \~\~\tab If you like, you can choose secondary traits that complement the defining characteristic. These secondary traits, called }{\i\fs24 corollary characteristics}{\fs24 
, add dimension to the character; in combination with the defining characteristic they help define a unique individual. The entries below list several corollary characteristic suggestions for each defining characteristic. Choose one or two 
that appeal to you, or make up your own. Any corollary characteristics are fine, so long as they don't contradict the defining characteristic; an }{\i\fs24 arrogant}{\fs24  ranger might also be }{\i\fs24 proud}{\fs24  and but it's unlikely he'd be }{
\i\fs24 shy}{\fs24 , too.
\par \~\~\tab Some kits work with certain def
ining characteristics better than others, and each entry below lists a few recommendations. However, don't feel restricted by them. You can use any defining characteristic with any kit that feels right to you. Likewise, you can mix and match the various c
orollary characteristics, or ignore them altogether. You may also use the defining characteristics in conjunction with the archetypes from the first four }{\i\fs24 Complete Handbooks}{\fs24  or to supplement the trait tables from the }{\i\fs24 
Complete Bard}{\fs24 . Regardless of your approach, the goal remains the same--to create ranger personalties that are believable and interesting.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 List of Defining Characteristics
\par }{\fs24 
\par }{\b\fs24 Altruistic}{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab A selfless humanitarian who puts the welfare of others before his own, the Altruis
tic ranger tirelessly fights for the common good. Unhampered by jealousy or self-interest, he commands respect from friends and foes alike. He shows mercy to his opponents, compassion to the dispossessed, and unwavering loyalty to his friends.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Corollary Characteristics:}{\fs24  Kind, honest, reserved, introverted, reverent, courteous.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Suggested Kits:}{\fs24  Beastmaster, Greenwood Ranger, Guardian, Seeker, Warden.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24 Analytical
\par }{\fs24 \~\~\tab An agile mind and eclectic interests mark the Analytical ranger. He loves knowledge and r
elishes every opportunity to ponder the mysteries of nature. New cultures, unusual creatures, and scholarly strangers fascinate him. He respects intellectual prowess more than physical skills, and may seek to negotiate with a potential opponent rather tha
n engage in combat.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Corollary Characteristics:}{\fs24  Ponderous, meticulous, dignified, thoughtful, cautious, dispassionate.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Suggested Kits:}{\fs24  Explorer, Seeker, Stalker.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24 Arrogant
\par }{\fs24 \~\~\tab 
An arrogant ranger believes he can do no wrong. He views indecision as weakness and compromise as cowardice. He glories in the memory of his accomplishments, which typically have been both numerous and impressive. If there are stronger, smarter, or more s
killed rangers than himself, he is unaware of them--or at least, he chooses not to acknowledge them.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Corollary Characteristics:}{\fs24  Haughty, confident, patronizing, energetic, extroverted, optimistic.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Suggested Kits:}{\fs24  Falconer, Forest Runner, Giant Killer, Mountain Man, Warden.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24 Boisterous
\par }{\fs24 \~\~\tab A boisterous ranger has little patience with social etiquette. He says what he thinks and behaves as he pleases, and may be oblivious to how his actions might offend others. A man of action, he likes to get to the poin
t, avoiding what he considers to be time-wasting conversation and endless planning. Beneath it all, there often beats a heart of purest gold.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Corollary Characteristics:}{\fs24  Brash, impulsive, lusty, spontaneous, intimidating, vulgar.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Suggested Kits:}{\fs24  Feralan, Forest Runner, Giant Killer, Mountain Man, Pathfinder.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24 Distrustful
\par }{\fs24 \~\~\tab Usually as a result of limited contact with other people, the distrustful ranger remains emotionally distant from strangers and comrades alike. He may be cordial and cooperative, bu
t he rarely gets close to anyone other than his animal followers. He is awkward in social situations, uncomfortable in large groups, and suspicious of friendly overtures. The reason is usually hidden in his past.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Corollary Characteristics:}{\fs24  Suspicious, paranoid, cold, reflective, lonely, moody.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Suggested Kits:}{\fs24  Beastmaster, Falconer, Feralan, Forest Runner, Mountain Man.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24 Inspiring
\par }{\fs24 \~\~\tab The inspiring ranger radiates authority and confidence, making him a natural leader. He instinctively takes charge in ti
mes of crisis, displaying bold initiative when others hesitate to act. His companions depend on his decisiveness and common sense, and he rarely lets them down. Always, he is the first to the battlefield and the last to leave.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Corollary Characteristics:}{\fs24  Flamboyant, fearless, cheerful, driven, virtuous, honorable.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Suggested Kits:}{\fs24  Explorer, Forest Runner, Justifier, Sea Ranger, Warden.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24 Laconic
\par }{\fs24    \tab The laconic ranger is a soft-spoken, thorough professional. He says little, sees much, and lets others go 
their own way as he goes his. He takes quiet pleasure in a job well done, and avoids needless confrontation with lazy, the foolish, and the incompetent (though he might remark with shrewd humor upon their foibles). He nearly always lends his neighbor a he
lping hand.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Corrollary Characteristics:}{\fs24  Steady, thoughtful, pithy, keen, practical, skilled, canny.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Suggested Kits:}{\fs24  Falconer, Guardian, Justifier, Pathfinder.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24 Melancholy
\par }{\fs24 \~\~\tab The melanch
oly ranger shoulders the weight of the world. Plagued with self-doubt and tormented by the injustice of a seemingly indifferent universe, he is preoccupied with his own misery and prone to deep depression. Ironically, though he may perceive himself as a f
ailure, he may actually be quite accomplished. Whatever success he experiences, however, doesn't seem to bring him much pleasure.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Corollary Characteristics:}{\fs24  Brooding, quiet, cynical, tentative, impulsive, neurotic.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Suggested Kits:}{\fs24  Guardian, Greenwood Ranger, Justifier, Warden, Seeker.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24 Merry
\par }{\fs24 \~\~\tab The merry ranger is full of the joy of life. He spreads springtime and sunlight wherever he goes, regardless of how bleak the situation may be. Always ready with a tale, a story, or a practical joke to break the
 tension, he puts the counsel of the eternal doom-sayer to shame. Though he may, in fact, have serious problems of his own, these never discourage him for long, nor does he inflict them on his companions.
\par    \tab }{\i\fs24 Corrollary Characteristics:}{\fs24  Bright, flippant, vibrant, honest, buoyant, optimistic.
\par    \tab }{\i\fs24 Suggested Kits: }{\fs24 Forest Runner, Mountain Man, Pathfinder, Sea Ranger.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24 Mysterious
\par }{\fs24 \~\~\tab The mysterious ranger envelops himself in an aura of secrecy, keeping even the most pedestrian details of his background hidden fro
m his companions. He seldom speaks, and when he does, his words may be ambiguous or laden with cryptic overtones. Though he dutifully fulfills his role within a party, he minimizes his contact with his comrades. For no apparent reason, he may disappear fo
r
 days at a time, then reappear as unexpectedly as he departed. He may whisper poetry to his followers, make bizarre notations on the trunks of trees, or brew sweet-smelling soup which he dumps on the ground rather than drink, all without explanation. His 
strange behavior may be due to religious reasons, cultural requirements, or merely a desire to keep his companions at arm's length.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Corollary Characteristics:}{\fs24  Eccentric, threatening, somber, distant, taciturn, studious.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Suggested Kits:}{\fs24  Feralan, Pathfinder, Seeker, Stalker.
\par }{\b\fs24 
\par Nurturing}{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab The nurturing ranger serves as a caretaker and counselor, supporting his companions and followers in times of stress. He comforts the troubled, reassures the doubtful, and soothes the anxious. He has a kind word for all
 and strives to bring out the best in his friends by bolstering their self-esteem. He may leave leadership roles to others, preferring to work in the background, or a loss of leadership or sudden crisis may bring him to the fore.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Corollary Characteristics:}{\fs24  Diplomatic, inquisitive, philosophic, humble, passive, empathetic.
\par \~\tab }{\i\fs24 Suggested Kits:}{\fs24  Falconer, Guardian, Greenwood Ranger, Seeker.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24 Obsessed}{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab A single, all-consuming goal motivates the obsessed ranger to the exclusion of all else. Typical obsessions 
include destroying a species enemy, revenge on an overlord who illegally annexed his territory, or locating a animal believed to be extinct. Though an obsessed ranger may function effectively within his party, the party=s objectives are always secondary t
o his own. Often, such a character will mature out of the obsession as the campaign continues.
\par \~\~\tab }{\i\fs24 Corollary Characteristics:}{\fs24  Irritable, grim, passionate, anxious, determined, tireless.

\par Chapter 9: Rangers and Religion
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab 
Most rangers are privately religious, convinced that there are powers at work in the world much greater than themselves. Though different rangers may worship in different ways, all regard the embodiment of their devotion with awe and respect, and try 
to abide by the ideals it represents.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf13 Aspects of Faith
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab Rangers manifest their faith in a number of ways:
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Inner Peace
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab A ranger's devotion gives him a sense of purpose, a feeling that his life has a purpose. Even though his role may seem at times to be minor, he feels that he has a definite place in the scheme of things.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Code of Behavior}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \~\~\tab A ranger's beliefs give structure to his life by providing a set of principles for him to follow. Being of good alignment, rangers tend to adopt beliefs that encourage honesty, compassion, and selflessness.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Access to Spells
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab In practical terms, the access to spells enjoyed by the high level ranger is one of the most immediate and visible results of a life of service. Much like a druid, the ranger receives hi
s spells as a consequence of his beliefs. Though prayer or meditation, the ranger asks for the spells he wishes to memorize, and in most cases, his requests are granted.
\par \~\~\tab Unlike the druid and other priests, the ranger's access to spells is limited. A pri
est, after all, devotes much energy to the service of his faith, while a ranger's other activities and duties place great demands on his time. For this reason, the ranger is able to acquire spells only when he reaches 8th level, and then has only minor ac
cess to the plant and animal spheres. The ranger can fill his spell slots with any spells of the appropriate level listed for those spheres. Some kits may have expanded or restricted spell use.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf13 Types of Faith
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab 
Many rangers venerate nature itself. Others develop private faiths, more follow recognized religions that are based on established traditions and doctrines. Rangers aren't necessarily affiliated with churches or monasteries; in fact, rangers generally avo
i
d formal religious organizations, preferring to worship alone or with a small group of trusted followers. Certainly the travels of most rangers often take them far from the centers of organized religion. As a result, a ranger's worship may differ from tha
t of a priest, even if they technically share the same faith.
\par \~\~\tab Regardless of how a ranger practices his faith, there will be some power that is the beneficiary of his devotion. Most rangers worship the divine in nature; monotheistic rangers worship one pa
rticular god, while polytheistic rangers may worship several. A few base their faith on an individual philosophy. All of these approaches provide support to their disciples, as well as access to the spells available to the a ranger. In game terms, they al
l function identically.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Nature
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab Many rangers choose nature itself as the focus of their devotion. Nature worshipers revere nature as a process and a source of life; whether it was designed by a greater intelligence or arose from the interaction of prima
l forces is largely irrelevant. Ethics and morals are derived from observing the natural order, and the perception of the majesty of the natural world and its relationship to the ranger is a closely personal one. The natural life force of the world can be
 
felt by the ranger who becomes attuned to it. Any ranger may be drawn to the worship of nature. For some rangers, particularly those with few ties to the civilized world (such as Beastmasters, Feralan, Greenwood Rangers, and Mountain Men), the pull is esp
ecially strong.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Gods}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \~\~\tab Gods are supernatural beings considered by their worshipers to be the supreme sources of might and authority. Often, a god embodies a particular principal that is manifested or promoted in the material world.
\par \~\tab The total number of 
gods is impossible to know, as are the number and identities of the rangers who worship them. These factors will vary from campaign world to campaign world. DM's who design customized pantheons for their own campaigns should consider including gods specif
ically intended for rangers. Gods concerned with agriculture, animals, plants, birth, fertility, geology, weather, and hunting are appropriate, providing they're of good alignment. One place to go for ideas is }{\i\fs24 The Complete Priest's Handbook}{
\fs24 , which contains many suggestions for adding religions to a campaign, and dozens of sample priesthoods.
\par \~\~\tab Rangers with gods worship them in a variety of ways. Some may erect simple shrines to their deities that complement the natural features of their primary terrain. For
 instance, a ranger whose primary terrain is Forest might plant a private grove. An Arctic ranger might build a towering ice pillar.
\par \~\~\tab Religious practices for the same deity may also vary from ranger to ranger, depending on their primary terrain. Prior to
 an important hunt, a Desert ranger might immerse his hands in the sand, a Forest ranger might conduct a spirited dance under a tall tree, and a Plains ranger might snap an arrow in two to attract the god's attention (a smooth break may be interpreted as 
an omen of a favorable hunt, while jagged edges may indicate that the god discourages hunting at that particular time).
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Philosophy
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab A belief system derived from intellectual concepts rather than supernatural forces or the natural world may also be the b
asis for a ranger's religion. The sheer intensity of the believers' devotion is sufficient to attract the magical energy necessary to cast spells.
\par \~\~Worshipers of philosophic faiths tend to concentrate in small sects in isolated areas of the world. For example, the Iulutiun rangers of the Great Glacier, for example, follow an animistic philosophy called }{\i\fs24 qukoku}{\fs24 
, which holds that all creatures share a life essence called }{\i\fs24 eaas}{\fs24 . The teachings of }{\i\fs24 qukoku }{\fs24 maintain that all creatures are morally equivalent, and that animals and men share the same emotions and intellect, which their 
}{\i\fs24 eaas}{\fs24  compels them to express in different ways. (For more about the Iulutiuns and }{\i\fs24 qukoku}{\fs24 , see the FORGOTTEN REALMS\'ae FR14 }{\i\fs24 Great Glacier}{\fs24  sourcebook.)
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf13 Expressions of Faith}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \~\~\tab Regardless of
 whether a ranger worships nature, gods, or a philosophy, he is assumed to engage in various practices to affirm his faith. Some of these practices may be formally established; for instance, a particular group of disciples may be required to kneel before 
t
he setting sun every day. Other practices may be self-imposed; a ranger may decide for himself that the best way to express his devotion is to refrain from violence during nights with a full moon. Once a player establishes a practice as routine for the ra
nger, the player and DM can assume the character continues it "off stage" unless campaign events dictate otherwise.
\par \~\~\tab It's up to the DM, in conjunction with the player, to decide what, if any practices a ranger should follow in order to remain true to his faith. Typical practices might include any of the following:
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Meditation.}{\fs24  Having private moments of quiet reflection and communion is a common practice. These may take the form of the soft verbal recitation of sacred verse, spoken at the same time every 
day, to periods of silent meditation, performed whenever the ranger gets a chance. Observing particular phenomena, such as a shooting star, or experiencing certain events, such as acquiring a new follower, may inspire special periods of this type.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Offerings.}{\fs24 
 The ranger make regular offerings of food or treasure. Offerings may be given to the underprivileged, cast into the sea, or buried in the ground. Small offerings, such as a scrap of meat or a few copper pieces, usually suffice.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Symbol Display.}{\fs24 
 The ranger may declare his devotion to the world by displaying the symbol of his faith. The symbol may be a distinctive article of clothing, a brooch or pendant, a tattoo, or a tiny mark made on a tree or stone wherever the ranger spends the night. The r
anger might mark his animal followers with the deity's symbol. The symbol may be engraved in a collar or bracelet, shaved into the animal's fur, or notched in the animal's horn.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Pilgrimage.}{\fs24  The ranger may make a periodic journey to a sacred location, suc
h as a temple, mountain peak, or holy village. The pilgrimage may take place on a particular date (say, the first day of spring) or whenever he gets the chance within a particular timeframe (he must make the pilgrimage once a year).
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Taboos.}{\fs24  Some faiths may impose strict prohibitions on the ranger's behavior. For example, the ranger may not be allowed to eat meat, wear head coverings, or start more than one fire in the same day.
\par \~\~\tab Players and DMs may also make up their own religious requirements. Remembe
r that a ranger might follow practices unlike other disciples of the same faith; just because most worshipers of a nature deity make shrines out of polished stone doesn't mean that a ranger can't build a shrine out of deer bones. Care should be taken to e
nsure that the practices don't conflict with the requirements of the ranger's character kit (it's unreasonable to expect a Sea Ranger to make an annual pilgrimage to the middle of a desert).
\par \~\~\tab Most importantly, any routine practices should be simple enough
 that they don't distract from the campaign or tie up an undue amount of the ranger's time and effort. A ranger who has to come up with a weekly offering of 500 gp or must spend four hours per day in solitude won't be welcome in very many parties.
\par \~\~\tab Once 
the practices are established, the ranger is expected to follow them. Should a ranger fail to uphold the requirements of the religion, or intentionally violate them, he may lose the use of his spells for a brief period, he may become ill, or one or more o
f
 his followers may desert him. The DM determines the penalty based on the severity of the ranger's negligence. In most cases, a warning should be enough (which the ranger may experience as a dream or vision), but continued abuse may call for a more severe
 response.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf13 Rangers and Druids
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab Rangers have much in common with druids. For instance, both classes are predominantly oriented toward nature. Both receive spells in similar ways; in fact, both of the ranger's spheres are shared with druids. Both strive t
o live up to the tenets of a higher power. They are natural allies against raiders, evil humanoids, and others who would despoil and ruin the land.
\par \~\~\tab Some rangers won't form anything other than casual relationships with druids. They may work with them on 
projects of mutual interest and occasionally call on them for guidance or advice, but otherwise the rangers go their own way, oblivious to how druids exercise their faith and not particularly concerned with what goes on in their places of worship. In spec
ial circumstances, however, rangers and druids may establish more formal alliances, especially when a druid becomes a ranger's follower.
\par \~\~\tab Any ranger may acquire a low-level druid as a follower, and may do so for a variety of reasons. If the ranger is skil
led in areas in which the druid is deficient, the druid may seek him out as a teacher. The druid's superior may instruct him to serve a ranger as part of a penance, or to serve as a go-between for a network of wilderness protectors that exchanges informat
ion and favors. Or like other human followers, the druid may be drawn by the ranger's reputation, hoping for a working relationship that will allow the projects of both to prosper.
\par \~\~\tab Secretive and mysterious, a druid may never let on as to why he's chosen 
to follow a ranger. He may simply show up, tag along, obey orders, then abruptly disappear a few weeks later. His initial appearance may be equally cryptic; a ranger who believes he's acquired a lizard or raccoon follower may be shocked to discover that t
he animal is, in fact, a shapechanged druid.
\par \~\~\tab Likewise, a low-level ranger may become a follower of a druid. Though many druids are reluctant to take on such strong-willed characters, open-minded druids are often receptive to rangers with a thirst for nat
ure lore and a commitment to conservation.
\par \~\~\tab Most of the time, however, rangers and druids operate independently. On occasion, they may find themselves competing for dominance of the same territory. A novice ranger who wishes to move into a region occupie
d by a druid may be wise to petition for permission, even though such permission is rarely required by law. Failure to do so may result in lasting resentment at best, open hostility at worst. Should the ranger act courteously and respectfully, permission 
is usually granted.
\par \~\~\tab Conversely, an initiate assigned to a ranger's territory would do well to request an audience with the ranger before settling in. Most rangers will appreciate the gesture, which minimizes the likelihood of misunderstandings or conflic
ts. A ranger probably won't attempt to drive away a druid who doesn't bother to make contact--assuming that the druid otherwise behaves himself--but relations between them may remain strained indefinitely.
\par \~\~\tab Because their outlooks are so similar, rangers 
and druids can usually share the same territory without any trouble, though their paths may seldom cross. Druids tend to keep to themselves even more than rangers. They are less likely than rangers to involve themselves in the affairs of men. Since they'r
e of neutral alignment, druids aren't particularly interested in promoting the ranger's conception of justice. Rangers tend to work more openly, druids more deviously.
\par \~\~\tab Rangers and druids may informally agree to divide the responsibilities of their territ
ory. The ranger may agree to deal with human and demihuman travelers, while the druid handles the problems of the native animals. They may join forces to contend with a natural disaster, only to part company when the danger has passed.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf13 Rangers and Clerics}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \~\~\tab 
Low-level clerics may become followers of rangers for many of the same reasons as druids. Not all clerics make suitable followers. The cleric must be of good alignment and should be several experience levels lower than the ranger. Since most rangers a
re human or half-elven, clerics of these races are the most likely to sign on, though a ranger will rarely reject a follower solely on account of race. Gender considerations usually aren't important, but a cleric with a strict upbringing may hesitate to f
ollow a ranger of the opposite sex.
\par \~\~\tab The faith of a clerical follower should be compatible with that of the ranger. This doesn't mean that the faiths must be identical--an inquisitive cleric might want to follow a ranger solely to study the nuances of an 
unusual religion--but the goals of the faiths can't be diametrically opposed. For instance, if the cleric believes that anyone who prays to inanimate objects is a heathen, he won't follow a ranger who worships mountains.
\par \~\~\tab A cleric serves the ranger in th
e same way as other followers--assisting him in combat, performing routine chores, and offering advice. In turn, the ranger benefits from the cleric's priestly skills and loyalty. The cleric may be able to assist with some of the ranger's religious requir
e
ments; for example, the cleric might handle the blessing of new followers, or come up with the daily offering of food or treasure. If they share the same faith, the cleric may teach the ranger new ways to worship, as well as engaging him in enlightening c
onversations concerning all things spiritual.
\par \~\~As with all followers, a cleric will remain in the company of a ranger as long as the relationship is mutually beneficial. When the cleric reaches the end of his penance or learns what he wants to know, he may
 express his desire to leave. A gracious ranger will grant this request, either dismissing or releasing the cleric at the earliest opportunity. Should the cleric prove to be a nuisance--or worse, if the ranger finds the cleric's religious practices to be 
unacceptable--the latter may be dismissed without explanation.
\par \~\~\tab Conversely, a ranger may find it advantageous to serve as a temporary follower of a cleric. He may seek out a cleric because an obligation requires him to spend a period of time working for a
 church, or because he wishes to learn more about that religion in a structured setting. Alternately, a ranger may volunteer to protect a clerical stronghold, or his deity may have commanded him to become a follower to show his dedication. Regardless of h
i
s motivation, a ranger usually serves as a follower for a limited period of time, seldom exceeding a few months. He typically begins his term of service early in his career, usually before reaching 3rd level. When his term ends, however, he may continue a
n informal relationship with that particular church for a much longer period.
\par \~\~\tab Clerics of 8th level or higher who establish large places of worship may accept ranger followers. Some clerics may have gender, racial, or kit preferences for their followers, 
but usually they'll accept any ranger whose faith is compatible with their own and who demonstrates a sincere commitment to serve. Once accepted, the ranger is expected to obey his clerical superiors and adhere to their traditions. The ranger may be requi
red, for instance, to pay a weekly offering for the upkeep of the fortification, take a vow of chastity, or wear a distinctive cloak or other garment. He may also be expected to perform any number of special duties. Typical duties might include:

may be confined to his quarters or given additional chores. Major infractions may result in beatings or even a banishment from the fortification. In extreme cases, the ranger's superiors may be able to exert their influence to permanently separate the ran
ger from their religion, causing him to lose all associated privileges and benefits.
\par \~\~\tab In the context of a game, a ranger's term as a clerical follower may take place between adventures, or it may be incorporated into a campaign, possibly as a springboard 
for an expedition involving the entire party (the ranger must complete a quest for his cleric, and recruits other companions to help him).
\par \~\~\tab A ranger's term as a clerical follower may have a variety of consequences, for weal or woe. On the good side, he m
ay make some powerful new contacts and learn some new skills. He may even acquire a new follower or two of his own (a low-level cleric or fighter decides to accompany the ranger when he leaves). On the other hand, the ranger may become burdened with new d
u
ties to perform (in exchange for his training, his clerical superiors now expect him to offer extra donations every month in their honor). At any time, he may be unexpectedly summoned to the clerical stronghold to help train novices or defend against atta
ckers.

\par 
\par Chapter 10: Forgatherings}{\b\fs24\cf13 
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab Though they generally avoid organizations and communal events, many rangers participate in informal get-togethers called }{\i\fs24 forgatherings}{\fs24  or moots. At forgatherings, rangers can exchange ideas, barter for supplies, and part
icipate in contests of skill, as well as catch up on gossip and blow off steam. Attendance at forgatherings is by no means mandatory, but most rangers look forward to the opportunity to spend a few days socializing with others who share the same general p
hilosophy and professional challenges.
\par \~\~\tab These are often times of much merriment and celebration. Old friends are greeted warmly and new rangers are initiated, sometimes with raucous practical joking. There are food and fun for all, and tests of skill and 
prowess to pass the time and take each other's measure.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf13 Attending a Forgathering
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab A ranger can go through his entire life without ever hearing about a forgathering, let alone attending one. But chances are that sooner or later, he'll hear a rumor about
 an upcoming forgathering, or receive an invitation from another ranger. He may also notice strange symbols etched on trees or stones, intended as guideposts to lead attendees to the forgathering site (depending on how secret is the location of the meetin
g, a ranger might need the trail sign proficiency to translate the symbols).
\par \~\~\tab In most cases, forgathering attendance requires no prior arrangements. These gatherings are by their nature informal, and they are rarely interrupted by serious business except 
under the most unusual circumstances. Any ranger who shows up is usually welcome; rangers who bring extra meat, fruit, or wine to share are welcomed with open arms. Attendees are expected to supply their own bedding, tents, and food. First-timers may be r
equired to perform extra chores, such as guard duty or trash disposal.
\par \~\~\tab A ranger may bring non-ranger companions with him as guests, providing the guests keep to themselves and stay out of the way. The ranger is responsible for his guests' behavior; shoul
d they cause trouble or make nuisances of themselves, both the ranger and his guests will be summarily ejected. It's unlikely that ranger will be welcome at any future forgatherings unless things are smoothed over.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf13 Types, Sites, and Dates
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab There are as
 many types of forgatherings as there are rangers. Some are held in well-traveled forests, others in remote deserts. Some attract only specific kit types, such as Mountain Men or Sea Rangers, while others are primarily intended for specific races, such as
 elves. In general, however, most forgatherings are open to any ranger who cares to come.
\par \~\~\tab Though some established forgatherings occasionally change locations and dates, most are held in the same place and at the same time every year for the convenience o
f the attendees. Any open wilderness area, reasonably isolated, can serve as a forgathering site. Forests, mountains, and plains are preferred, as they give the easiest access to the greatest number of rangers. Because travel can be difficult in the winte
r
, and summer can bring uncomfortably hot temperatures, forgatherings are usually held in late spring or early fall. Most forgatherings last from two to three days, but some drag on for several weeks or until the last few diehards call it quits and head fo
r home.
\par \~\~\tab Specifics about individual forgatherings are hard to come by, since rangers tend to keep the details to themselves. Brief descriptions follow, the pieced-together bits and pieces of information that have trickled out over the years regarding a fe
w of the best-attended and longest-lived meetings: feel free to add to them and adapt them to your campaign world.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Equinox Festival
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab 
One of the most important annual meetings is the gathering at this festival, held during the six days following the first full moon after the autumn equinox. Rangers of every type and specialty can be found here, though standard rangers outnumber all the 
o
thers. The site shifts every other year, alternating between a heavily forested area and a plains region, far from any civilized settlement. The organizers announce next year's site at the end of the current festival.  As this is primarily a trade fair, r
angers bring a wide variety of goods to sell, and haggle with each other long into the night. Prices tend to be high, but so does the quality.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Glass Eye Concourse
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab This is one of the wildest and least structured forgatherings, attracting Mountain Men by
 the dozens, along with a few rowdy Giant Killers, Pathfinders, and Forest Runners. The name derives from the person who organized the first of these forgatherings, a rowdy Mountain Man who lost an eye in a drunken sharpshooting contest. Held near the bas
e of a tall mountain in mid-spring, the Glass Eye Concourse features a weekend of physical contests, lewd jokes, and lots and lots of cheap ale.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 High Tide Assembly
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab In contrast to most forgatherings, the High Tide Asse
mbly is downright sedate, emphasizing philosophic discussion and formal lectures. This forgathering takes place during the first high tide of spring on a quiet seashore. The Assembly lasts for three days. Seekers, Sea Rangers, and Explorers are the primar
y attendees. By tradition, the forgathering climaxes with a wild boar hunt. Following a traditional feast, the bones of the wild boars are tossed into the sea, to the accompaniment of triumphant cheers and whistles.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf13 Solstice Jamboree}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \~\~\tab Most often held in
 a central plains location, the Solstice Jamboree attracts all types of rangers, as well as a number of bards and druids. The event lasts for six days, beginning on the first day of the summer solstice. Lavish banquets, featuring exotic meats and rich can
d
ies are held three times daily, and general good fellowship is encouraged. This is an important event, for much serious business is discussed on the side. Comrades who died the previous year are honored on the last day of the forgathering with poetry reci
tations and silent meditations.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf13 Physical Layout}{\b\fs24\cf13 
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab Most forgathering sites have few permanent features or structures. Upon their arrival, attendees construct any necessary buildings or fixtures, and take them down when the forgathering ends. Forgathering 
fixtures are simple but functional, with building materials consisting usually of wood, stones, and mud. Here are a few features common to most sites:
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Sleeping Area.}{\fs24  The driest and clearest patch of ground makes the best sleeping area. Attendees pitch t
heir tents or lay out their sleeping bags in lines, spaced well apart. In colder climates, the sleeping area is located where the sun (whatever there is of it) can warm the earth before nightfall. In warmer climates, shady locations are preferred.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Dining Area.}{\fs24 
 A typical dining area consists of a few benches or logs for sitting on, some stone barbecue pits, and a simple lean-to for storage. The optimum location for the dining area is several hundred feet from the sleeping area, positioned so that breezes 
don't carry the cookfire smoke in the direction of resting rangers. A stream nearby for washing up is also desirable, if available.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Fire Pit.}{\fs24  A pit for burning waste is constructed near the dining area, preferably away from trees or brush to minimize th
e chance of a fire getting out of control. It's located where the prevailing breezes don't carry the smell of burning garbage toward the sleeping or dining areas.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Barn.}{\fs24  A barn, stable, or pen is constructed to house the rangers' animal followers for the
 duration of the forgathering. Large forgatherings may require several pens and stables to accommodate a variety of species. Rangers are responsible for the feeding and grooming of their animals, and are also held accountable for their animals' behavior; 
it's considered a grievous breech of etiquette for a lion follower of one ranger to eat the goat follower of another ranger.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Chapel.}{\fs24  The forgathering chapel may be as simple as a stone platform, or as elaborate as a full-sized cabin with a podium and woo
den pews. Religious symbols are not exhibited here, so that the chapel may accommodate worshipers of diverse beliefs. Most often, the chapel is isolated from the main forgathering site, erected in a nearby woodland or other quiet location.
\par \~\~\tab }{\b\fs24 Campfire.}{\fs24  The
 communal campfire, typically constructed in a central location, serves as the focal point of the forgathering. The campfire burns all night and day, continually tended and fed deadfall logs. At any hour, rangers can be found crowding around the camp fire
, roasting meat and exchanging stories.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf13 Activities and Events
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab As forgatherings are primarily intended as social events, rarely are there fixed agendas or schedules. Activities tend to develop spontaneously, continue as long as the rangers show an inter
est, and end when the participants have had enough. Following are a few of the activities and events most likely to occur:
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24 Trading}{\fs24 .
\par \tab Trading goes on virtually non-stop at most forgatherings, ranging from private transactions between individuals to dozens 
of rangers peddling their wares in what amounts to an open air market. Merchandise includes both the common (rope, saddles, boots) and the unusual (chainlink leashes, camouflage paint, homemade wine). Weapons and maps are especially in demand, particularl
y bows and quarterstaves with hand-carved designs, and maps of exotic territories that detail the newest trails. Rangers pay for their purchases in fur, food, and trinkets as well as gold pieces.
\par \~\~\tab Magical items are occasionally available, but many rangers
 are more inclined to loan them to needy comrades rather than sell them outright. Rangers who borrow magical items are expected to return them at the next forgathering. Being men and women of integrity, the borrowers rarely fail to honor their agreements.

\par 
\par }{\b\fs24 News and Gossip.
\par }{\fs24 \tab Information flows freely at forgatherings, and most rangers are eager to learn about the trials and tribulations their comrades have experienced in the previous year. They hear of marriages, births, and deaths, as well as followers acqui
red and abandoned. They learn which expeditions resulted in new discoveries and which ended in disaster. Rumors abound of lost civilizations, hidden treasures, and gruesome monsters. An attentive ranger may hear about employment opportunities or new hunti
ng grounds. If he's lucky, an unattached ranger may make contact with a potential mate.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24 Training.
\par }{\fs24 \tab The typical forgathering attracts rangers with a wide range of skills. Often, they're willing to give instruction to novices for a small fee or as a gesture 
of friendship. If he locates a willing teacher, a ranger may be able to pick up hunting or tracking tips, acquire cooking secrets from a master chef, or learn how to construct emergency shelters from an elder woodsman. (The optional training rules in Chap
ter 8 of the }{\i\fs24 DUNGEON MASTER Guide}{\fs24  can be used to allow rangers to acquire new skills as a result of their forgathering experiences.)
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24 Contests.
\par }{\fs24 \tab No forgathering would be complete without games and contests for rangers to demonstrate their skills and compete
 for prizes. Conservative forgatherings feature debates, target shooting, and knotting matches (where contestants see who can untangle complex knots in the shortest time). The Glass Eye Concourse and similarly rowdy forgatherings feature contests of a mor
e physical nature, such as head-slamming (contestants butt heads as hard as they can until one passes out), dagger juggling (often done blindfolded), and bear wrestling.
\par \~\~\tab Mountain Men in particular have a tradition of rather intense competition. For examp
le, Mountain Men enjoy a bizarre drinking contest where bitter roots, fish scales, rotten vegetables, and other distasteful substances are mixed with water; whoever consumes the most of this vile brew is declared the winner.
\par \~\~\tab Other contests common to for
gatherings include horse races, rabbit hunts, and mock battles using swords and spears bound with thick layers of cloth. Winners are awarded silver pendants, hiking boots, or other prizes donated by the more affluent attendees. If donations aren't availab
le, each participant puts a few coins in a pot before a contest begins; whoever wins claims the pot. Wagering is rampant for all types of contests, with rangers betting everything from animal pelts and dried meat, to arrowheads and leather gloves.

\par }{\b\fs28\cf13 Class Description
\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\~\tab Rangers are a sub-class of fighter who are adept at woodcraft, tracking, scouting, infiltration, and spying. All rangers must be of good alignment, although they can be lawful good, chaotic good, or neutral
 good. A ranger must have a Strength score of at least 13, Intelligence of at least 13, Wisdom of at least 14, and Constitution of at least 14. If the ranger has ability scores of greater than 15 in Strength, Intelligence, }{\i\fs24 and}{\fs24 
 Wisdom, he gains the benefit of adding 10% to experience points awarded by the referee.
\par \~\~\tab Unlike other members of the fighter group, rangers have eight-sided Hit Dice (d8) but at first level they get 2, rather then 1, Hit Dice. It should also be noted that rangers get 11 Hit Dice rat
her than the 9 of other fighter-types. Table 61 shows the experience points needed for each level, along with the associated titles. Table 62 lists the number of attacks per round a ranger can make at various levels.

\par }{\fs24 
\par \~\tab \~In addition to considerable prowess as fighters, rangers have druidic and magical spell capabilities when they attain high levels. Thus, they are very formidable opponents, for they have other abilities and benefits as well.
\par \~\~\tab When fighting humanoid-type 
creatures of the "giant class," listed hereafter, rangers add 1 hit point for each level of experience they have attained to the points of damage scored when they hit in melee combat. Giant class creatures are listed on Table 66. }{\b\fs24 Example:}{
\fs24  a 5th level range
r hits a bugbear in melee combat, and the damage done to the opponent will be according to the ranger's weapon type, modified by his Strength, and +5 (for his or her experience level) because the opponent is a bugbear (a "giant class" humanoid).
\par \~\~\tab Rangers surprise opponents when rolling 1-3 on 1d6 and are themselves surprised only when rolling 1 on 1d6.
\par \~\~\tab Tracking is possible both outdoors and underground (in dungeons and similar settings). Underground, the ranger must have observed the creature to be tra
cked within 3 turns (30 minutes) of the commencement of tracking, and the ranger must begin tracking at a place where the creature was observed. Table 63 lists the ranger's chance to track creatures underground in various situations.

\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf13 Special Restrictions}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \~\~\tab Any change to non-good alignment immediately strips the ranger of all benefits, and the character becomes a fighter, with eight-sided Hit Dice ever after. He can never again regain ranger status.
\par \~\~\tab Rangers may not hire men-at-arms, servants, aides, or henchmen until they attain 8th level or higher.
\par \~\~\tab No more than three rangers may ever operate together at any time.
\par \~\~\tab Rangers may own only those goods and treasures which they can carry on their person and/or place upon their mount. All excess must be donated to a worthy communal or institutional cause (but never to another player character).
\par \~\~\tab Rangers do not attract a body of mercenaries to serve them, but when (and if) rangers construct strongholds, they conform to the fighter class in other respects.
