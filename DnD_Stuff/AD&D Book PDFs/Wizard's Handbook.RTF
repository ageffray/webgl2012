\par }{\b\fs32\cf2 Introduction}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab \tab No concept is more fundamental to the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS\'ae
 2nd Edition game than magic. And no character class better personifies the art of magic than its primary practitioner, the wizard. No class is more challenging, few are as elegant, and in the hands of a creative player, none is as fascinating. The AD&D
\'ae 2nd Edition }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook}{\fs24  and }{\i\fs24 DUNGEON MASTER\'ae Guide}{\fs24  explained all of the basic information necessary for playing wizard characters. In this book, we'll expand on that information, add
ing more details and options and offering a few new variations. For instance, we'll be taking a close look at all the schools of magic, examining their advantages and disadvantages, their requirements and benefits, and the types of characters that are bes
t suited for particular specializations. Since the schools of magic aren't limited to those presented in the }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook}{\fs24 , we'll show you how to create your own schools from scratch. 
\par \tab \tab We'll discuss ways to personalize your wizard characters and descr
ibe entire campaigns centered on wizardly concerns. If you've been bemoaning the lack of spells for certain specialists, such as diviners and necromancers, worry no more -- we've added plenty of new spells just for them. 
\par 
\par \tab \tab For the Dungeon Master, we'll o
ffer some tips to help fine-tune his skills as a referee, covering such topics as the adjudication of illusions and how to establish guidelines for magical research. We'll explain how spells are cast underwater and in other planes of existence. And for pl
ayers and DMs alike, we'll take a close look at combat and how it relates to wizards. 
\par 
\par \tab \tab Think of this book as a smorgasbord of ideas. Everything here is optional. Pick and choose whatever's most appealing, make changes to suit your campaign, and experimen
t with variations of your own design. It's your game and your world -- we're here to help you make it as entertaining as it can be. 
\par 
\par \tab \tab Throughout this book, we've used male pronouns as a matter of convenience. This is not intended to exclude females -- in all cases, read "his" as "his or her," and "he" as "he or she. " For those of you using}{\i\fs24  The Complete Wizard}{
\fs24  in conjunction with the original AD&D game instead of the AD&D 2nd Edition game, this supplement mentions many page numbers from the }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook}{\fs24  and the }{\i\fs24 DUNGEON MASTER Guide}{\fs24 
. The page numbers cited refer to the AD&D 2nd Edition books. Those players using the old books will have to ignore these page references, but in most cases, you can find the relevant material by consulting the indexes or co
ntents pages of the original books. 
\par }{\b\fs32\cf2 
\par Chapter 1: Schools of Magic}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab \tab In this chapter, we'll take a close look at the various schools of magic, analyzing their strengths and weaknesses, examining their spells, and sizing up their specialists. We'll also loo
k at the minor schools and explore the implications of abandoning a school. The schools of magic add many interesting possibilities to a campaign. But not every wizard is destined to be a specialist, and not every player wants to play a specialist charact
er. So let's begin with a basic question
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 To Specialize or Not to Specialize?}{\fs24  
\par 
\par \tab \tab The most crucial decision a beginning wizard must make is whether to specialize in a school of magic or instead opt for the life of a mage. Each has its advantages and disadva
ntages. For instance, the mage has a chance to learn any new spell he encounters, but the specialist's opportunities are more limited -- he cannot learn spells from schools that are in opposition to his own. The specialist has stricter racial and ability 
requirements than the mage, but he also has better saving throw bonuses. 
\par \tab \tab The choice to specialize can have profound effects on a wizard's role in the game, and players should think carefully before committing their characters to a school of magic. Following are a few points to consider.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Ability Scores}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab \tab A wizard must meet certain ability requirements to become a specialist. For instance, a wizard with a Dexterity of 15 can't become an illusionist. But even if low ability scores haven't eliminated all of
 the specialization choices, the player should still look at his character's Intelligence score and see how it affects his chance of learning spells. An Intelligence of 9 means that the character will have a 50 percent chance to learn spells of his specia
lity based on the normal 35 percent chance to learn a new spell for an Intelligence of 9 (Table 4 on page 16 of the }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook}{\fs24  ) plus a 15 percent bonus for being a specialist. 
\par \tab \tab An Intelligence of 17 means that the character will have a 90 percent 
chance to learn spells of his specialty (the normal 75 percent chance for an Intelligence of 17 plus a 15 percent bonus for being a specialist). Notice that the 15 percent bonus helps the character with the lower Intelligence more than it does the charact
er with the higher Intelligence; the bonus boosts the Intelligence 9 character's chance from 35 to 50, an increase of more than 40 percent, while the Intelligence 17 character's chance is increased from 75 to 90, which is a boost of only 20 percent. 

\par \tab Clear
ly, the lower the Intelligence of a wizard, the more specialization helps to increase his chance of learning spells. This is somewhat offset by the specialist's limitations to which spells he can learn (he can't learn spells from oppositional schools), bu
t over the course of a campaign, a low Intelligence wizard stands a good chance of learning more spells by specializing
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 1st-Level Bonus Spell}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab \tab A 1st-level specialist begins with two spells, but a 1st-level mage begins with only one. This difference is inconsequential over the course of a long campaign, but it can be significant if playing a short adventure with low-level characters

\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Personality and Background of the Player Character}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab \tab Some aspect of the player character's personality might suggest whethe
r he's best suited for the life of a mage or that of a specialist. An impulsive, overeager character might lack the patience for the studious life of a specialist. Conversely, a thoughtful, scholarly character might find the life of a mage too confining. 
A character who comes from a long line of mages might want to continue the family tradition. A character whose brother was killed by an evil specialist NPC might want to study the same school to prepare himself for a confrontation with the murderer
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Access to Mentors
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab \tab Does the wizard character have easy access to a mentor of his preferred school? Is the mentor in ill health, is his city under siege, or is his future otherwise in question? Although there are ways to learn spells without a mentor (or magic a
cademy), the wizard may want to think carefully before committing to a specialization if he can't depend on the availability of his mentor (or academy) for consultation and further training. 
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Party Composition}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab \tab If the character's party already includes 
one or more mages, the wizard might choose a specialization to give the party a wider variety of character types. If the party is small, it might be less risky to become a mage so that the character has access to spells of all the schools. Are there other
 
player-character wizards with spell books they'd be willing to share? Would a specialist or a mage have a better chance of learning those spells? (If one PC wizard is a conjurer, his spell book probably won't be useful to a PC wizard who wants to be a div
iner.)
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Player Preference}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab \tab A player might want to run a wizard of a particular specialty just because he's never tried it before, and that's as good a reason as any to choose a specialist over a mage
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Chance to Learn Spells}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab \tab Consider the opportunities t
hat mages and specialists have to learn new spells, perhaps the most compelling difference between them. As illustration, compare a mage with an Intelligence of 9 and an illusionist with an Intelligence of 9. The mage has a 35 percent chance of learning e
a
ch new spell he encounters, regardless of its school. The illusionist has a 50 percent chance of learning illusionist spells, a 20 percent chance of learning alteration, divination, enchantment/charm, and conjuration/summoning spells (this percentage refl
ects the 15 percent penalty for learning spells from other schools). The illusionist has no chance of learning spells from the schools of invocation/evocation, abjuration, or necromancy, since these schools are in opposition to the school of illusion. 

\par \tab \tab As
sume that in a typical adventure, the mage and the illusionist each have the opportunity to learn 16 new spells from discovered spell books, NPC wizards, and other sources. Also assume that of these 16 spells, two are from each of the eight schools. The m
a
ge has a 35 percent chance of learning each of these spells, meaning that he is likely to learn five or six of them. The illusionist is denied the chance to learn six of them (from the oppositional schools); he has a 50 percent chance of learning two of t
hem (meaning he is likely to learn one of the two), and a 20 percent chance of learning eight of them (meaning he is likely to learn two spells). In this example, the mage learns six spells, while the illusionist learns only three. 
\par \tab \tab It doesn't improve for specialists with higher Intelligence scores; at Intelligence 16, for instance, a mage will learn about 12 of the 16 spells, while the illusionist will learn approximately eight of them. 
\par \tab \tab Of course, the specialist receives a bonus spell when he advances 
a level, and the differences are less severe for certain specialties (diviners, for instance, are denied access to only one school). But over the course of a typical campaign, a mage will likely learn far more spells than a specialist
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Short Adventure vs. Long Campaign}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab \tab Since there is no meaningful difference between a mage and a specialist in their abilities to cast the spells they know, wouldn't the wise player always choose to play a mage? Not necessarily. In the long run, the specialist's experience b
onus, saving throw bonuses, and acquired powers (see the listings in the school descriptions below) make him a far more formidable opponent than the mage. Additionally, the limits on the number of spells a wizard can use and know mean that the specialist 
will eventually catch up to the mage in these areas. 
\par \tab \tab One guideline for deciding between a mage and a specialist might be to consider a mage if playing a short adventure. But for a lengthy campaign, a specialist is probably the best bet; not only will he 
prove to be a more effective party member, but a character with focused goals and aptitudes will be more interesting to play
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 About the Schools}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab \tab Following are details about specialists for each school of magic. Each includes the following information: 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Description:}{\fs24  This section explains the general effects created by spells from the school, along with how the magical energy is channelled. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Specialist Name:}{\fs24  The common name for a specialist of this school. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Allowed Races:}{\fs24  Only humans, gnomes, elves, and half-elves can be specialists, and not all races are able to specialize in every school. This entry indicates which races are eligible to specialize in a particular school. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Ability Requirements:}{\fs24  Though all schools require a minimum Intelligence of 9, each has an additional minimum requirement in another ability and is listed here. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Saving Throw Modifiers:}{\fs24  Because of their familiarity with the arcane arts, specialists are able to resist the effects of certain forms of magic. Additionally, their oppon
ents are less able to resist certain spells cast by specialists rather than non-specialists. These are listed here. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Bonus Spells and Acquired Powers:}{\fs24  These are the special abilities and extra spells that specialists automatically receive when they reach
 high levels. (The use of acquired powers is an option only; at the DM's discretion, he can eliminate them from his campaign, or even develop others for high-level specialists. ) 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Oppositional Schools:}{\fs24  The specialist is unable to learn spells from these schools. He is also forbidden to use magical items that duplicate the effects of schools in opposition to his own school. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Spell Analysis:}{\fs24  This section discusses the spells available to the school, including their general types and their overall usefulne
ss to the wizard. For convenience, spells are divided into three categories: Low (1st-3rd level), Medium (4th-6th level), and High (7th-9th level). The most versatile and powerful spells are designated as the "Most Desirable" for each of these categories.
 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Ethos: }{\fs24 
This section details the wizard's relationship to society, his goals and values, his overall philosophy, how he spends his time, and his likely role in an adventuring party. Since certain types of people tend to veer toward the same fields of stu
dy, some personality descriptions common to specialists of the school are also included. 
\par \tab \tab Note that these are general guidelines only, and any number of exceptions are possible, but they can be used to help the player shape his character's personality or
 help him decide which school seems most appropriate for the character he has in mind
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Abjuration}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Description:}{\fs24  Spells of this school focus magical energies to provide protection. This protection can take a number of forms, including warding off specific
 types of weapons or creatures and discouraging or dispelling enemies. The school also includes a variety of spells involving avoidance and repellence. Abjuration spells concentrate on eliminating or hindering sources of potential harm rather than repairi
ng damage. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Specialist Name:}{\fs24  Abjurer. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Allowed Races:}{\fs24  Only humans can be abjurers. It's speculated that the natural magical resistance of elves, half-elves, and gnomes prevents them from mastering abjuration spells. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Ability Requirements:}{\fs24  A wizard must have strong intuition and exceptional willpower to master abjuration spells as reflected in a high Wisdom score. Specialists in this school must have a minimum Wisdom of 15. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Saving Throw Modifiers:}{\fs24  All opponents modify their saving throws by -1 when attempting to save against an abjuration spell cast by an abjurer. An abjurer adds a +1 bonus when saving against abjuration spells. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Bonus Spells and Acquired Powers:}{\fs24  An abjurer can memorize an extra spell at each spell level, providing that at least one of t
he memorized spells is from the school of abjuration; thus, a 1st-level abjurer can memorize two spells. When an abjurer reaches 17th level, he acquires immunity to all forms of }{\i\fs24 hold}{\fs24 
 spells and adds a +1 bonus when saving against poison, paralyzation, and 
death magic. When an abjurer reaches 20th level, his mastery of magical protective forces has become so powerful that his Armor Class is raised from 10 to 9. He is still forbidden to wear armor. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Oppositional Schools:}{\fs24  An abjurer cannot learn spells from the schools of alteration and illusion. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Spell Analysis:}{\fs24  The abjurer has a limited number of spells from which to choose, particularly in the lower levels. This lack of options makes low-level abjurers among the weakest of beginning wizards. To compensate,
 he should acquire a few low-level spells from other available schools as early in his career as possible. Offensive spells-- that is, spells that inflict damage-- from the school of alteration are especially good choices, such as}{\i\fs24 
 burning hands, shocking grasp, strength}{\fs24 , and }{\i\fs24 Melf's minute meteors}{\fs24 
. As he reaches higher levels of ability and is able to take advantage of the more powerful abjuration spells available to him, an abjurer should become less dependent on spells from other schools. 
\par \tab \tab There are three general types of abjuration spells: protective, dispelling, and dismissal. Protective spells include those that offer protection from creatures (such as }{\i\fs24 protection from evil}{\fs24 
), those that protect against weapons (such as }{\i\fs24 protection from normal missiles}{\fs24 ), and those that protect against certain types of magic (such as }{\i\fs24 minor globe of invulnerability}{\fs24 
). Dispelling spells cause the elimination of specific magical effects, such as}{\i\fs24  dispel magic}{\fs24  and }{\i\fs24 remove curse}{\fs24 . Dismissal spells cause the removal of certain creatures, such as }{\i\fs24 dismissal}{\fs24  and }{\i\fs24 
banishment}{\fs24 . 
\par \tab \tab Since the most effective abjurations are those offering the greatest protection, it seems that the dismissal spells are the most desirable-- after all, they get rid of the attacker altogether. However, dismissal sp
ells are effective only against very specific types of attackers, such as}{\i\fs24  banishment 's}{\fs24  dismissal of extraplanar creatures. Unless the wizard anticipates encountering the type of creature affected, a }{\i\fs24 dismissal }{\fs24 
spell won't be helpful. Since protection spells usually affect only a single individual, the best all-purpose abjurations are the dispelling spells; }{\i\fs24 dispel magic}{\fs24 
 for instance, employed against a magic-wielding enemy protects not only the caster, but the entire party. 
\par \tab \tab The abjurer is at a disadvantag
e when attacking. There are very few abjuration spells that inflict damage either directly or indirectly. But in terms of defensive capabilities, the abjurer is second to none. When a party is exploring potentially dangerous territory, the abjurer makes a
n
 ideal point man, placing him in an excellent position to create defenses against attackers. The abjurer, like all wizards, has a poor Armor Class, making him extremely vulnerable to damage. A comrade with a lot of hit points and a low AC should accompany
 the abjurer near the front of the party, ready to intercept attacks and act as the abjurer's bodyguard. 
\par \tab \tab Abjurers also operate well in conjunction with other wizards. While the abjurer casts magical defenses, a fellow wizard can concentrate on creating m
agical offenses. When traveling, abjurers make good guards for helpless NPCs, such as small children and elderly citizens. Does the party have a treasure map, a valuable gem, or other prized possession? With his repertoire of protective spells, the abjure
r may be the best person to carry them. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Most Desirable Spells:}{\fs24  Low-Level: }{\i\fs24 Dispel magic}{\fs24 
 is not only the best of the low-level abjuration spells, it should be a part of any wizard's arsenal (excluding, of course, those specialists to whom abjuration is forbidden). }{\i\fs24 Dispel magic}{\fs24 
 can effectively disarm many opponents, and it can also negate harmful or potentially harmful magical devices. Abjurers would do well to acquire this spell early in their careers. }{\i\fs24 Protection from evil}{\fs24  is another useful spell, consideri
ng how often a typical party encounters evil creatures and evil NPCs. Of the two 3rd-level protection spells, an abjurer will likely find}{\i\fs24  protection from evil, 10' radius}{\fs24  to be more helpful than}{\i\fs24  protection from normal missiles}
{\fs24 , since he will probably have more opportunities to use the former than the latter. Note that }{\i\fs24 protection from normal missiles}{\fs24 
 can be extremely helpful when traveling through primitive areas where the inhabitants are more likely to use rocks and spears than swords and maces.
\par \tab Medium-Level:}{\i\fs24  Fire trap}{\fs24  not only offers superb protection, it's one of the few abjuration spells capable of inflicting damage. Avoidance has the twin advantages of being reversible and permanent.}{\i\fs24  Anti-magic shell}{\fs24 
 is generally preferable to }{\i\fs24 globe of invulnerability}{\fs24 ; not only does it last longer, it's stronger and takes less time to cast. 
\par \tab \tab High-Level:}{\i\fs24  Spell turning}{\fs24  and }{\i\fs24 Serten's spell immunity}{\fs24  are extremely powerful spells that should be useful in any hostile environment. In most situations, }{\i\fs24 prismatic sphere}{\fs24  is the be
st high-level abjuration spell; it not only provides a variety of defenses, it is also capable of blinding most opponents and inflicting a sizeable amount of damage. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Ethos:}{\fs24  Concerned with protection, abjurists have a deep reverence for life and are attr
acted to philosophies stressing compassion and selflessness. Accordingly, most abjurers are of good alignment. Evil-aligned abjurers are often toadies of an intimidating evil warrior or in the service of a more powerful wizard of another school. Abjurers 
tend to be thoughtful, orderly, gentle-natured, and soft-spoken, going out of their way not to attract attention. 
\par \tab \tab Of all the wizards, abjurers seem to have the strongest family ties. Abjurers take comfort in the security of marriage and often choose thei
r mates at an early age; many abjurers have ten or more offspring. Owing to their mastery of protective forces, abjurers tend to live to a ripe old age; it's not unusual to find abjurers well into their eighties in adventuring parties. 
\par \tab \tab Abjurers make the
ir homes anywhere, but prefer small villages to large cities. Because of their kind hearts and generous spirits, abjurers are held in high esteem by society in general. Abjurers commonly earn a living as guides, bodyguards, merchants, and teachers

\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Alteration}{\fs24  
\par 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Description:}{\fs24  Spells of this school enable the caster to channel magical energies to cause direct and specific change in an existing object, creature, or condition. Alterations can affect a subject's form (}{\i\fs24 
polymorph other}{\fs24 ), weight (}{\i\fs24 feather fall}{\fs24 ), abilities (}{\i\fs24 strength}{\fs24 ), location (}{\i\fs24 teleport without error}{\fs24 ), or even his physical well-being (}{\i\fs24 death fog}{\fs24 ). 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Specialist Name:}{\fs24  Transmuter. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Allowed Races:}{\fs24  Only a caster with human blood can channel the magical energies necessary for alteration spells. Hence, only humans and half-elves can become transmuters. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Ability Requirements:}{\fs24  Because alteration spells have somewhat more complex somatic components than spells from other schools, a wizard needs a Dexterity score of at least 15 to become a transmuter. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Saving Throw Modifiers:}{\fs24 
 All opponents modify their saving throws by -1 when attempting to save against an alteration spell cast by a transmuter. A transmuter adds a +1 bonus when saving against alteration spells cast by others. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Bonus Spells and Acquired Powers:}{\fs24 
 A transmuter can memorize an extra spell at each spell level, providing that at least one of the memorized spells is from the school of alteration. When a transmuter reaches 17th level, he receives one extra non- weapon wizard proficiency of his choi
ce; this is in addition to the number of non-weapon proficiencies he is normally allowed. When he reaches 20th level, he receives another extra non-weapon wizard proficiency. If the wizard already has all of the non-weapon wizard proficiencies available t
o him when he reaches level 17 (or level 20), he may take a general non-weapon proficiency instead. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Oppositional Schools:}{\fs24  A transmuter can't learn spells from the schools of abjuration and necromancy. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Spell Analysis:}{\fs24  No school has a wider variety of spells than the school of alteration, making the transmuter the most versatile of all the specialists. The available spells can be assigned to six general groups: 
\par \tab \tab 1. Defensive Spells. This group of protective spells offers defensive capabilities rivaling those of the abjuration school. This group includes spells that limit an opponent's ability to attack, such as }{\i\fs24 fog cloud, solid fog, slow}{
\fs24 , and }{\i\fs24 darkness, 15' radius}{\fs24 , and also spells that provide direct protection to the caster and his party, such as}{\i\fs24  stoneskin}{\fs24  and }{\i\fs24 Leomund's tiny hut}{\fs24 . 
\par \tab \tab 2. Offensive Spells. This group includes spells such as }{\i\fs24 strength}{\fs24  and }{\i\fs24 haste }{\fs24 which increase the party's chance to inflict damage, and spells such as }{\i\fs24 Melf's minute meteors}{\fs24  and }{\i\fs24 
death fog}{\fs24  which inflict damage directly. 
\par \tab \tab 3. Mobility Spells. This group includes }{\i\fs24 fly, blink, passwall}{\fs24 , and }{\i\fs24 teleport}{\fs24  and other spells that improve the caster's ability to move from place to place.
\par \tab \tab 4. Security Spells. This group enables the caster to protect objects and places, and includes spells such as }{\i\fs24 wizard lock, guards and wards}{\fs24 , and }{\i\fs24 Leomund's secret chest}{\fs24 . 
\par \tab \tab 5. Talent Spells. This group gives the caster (or a person of the caster's choice) a temporary talent, usually one that duplicates a special ability of another creature or race. Such spells include }{\i\fs24 infravision, water breathing,}{\fs24 
 and }{\i\fs24 tongues}{\fs24 . 
\par \tab \tab 6. Special Spells. This group encompasses a wide range of spells that don't fit into into any of the previous categories, such as }{\i\fs24 magic mouth, mending, message}{\fs24 , and }{\i\fs24 fool's gold}{\fs24 . Because of the variety of 
spells available, a transmuter can assume a number of different roles in an adventuring party. For instance, a transmuter who knows a number of offensive spells can battle effectively alongside a party's warriors. A transmuter who knows a few mobility spe
lls in addition to some offensive spells makes an especially impressive combatant (imagine a }{\i\fs24 flying}{\fs24  transmuter soaring to the top of a tree, then casting }{\i\fs24 Melf's minute meteors}{\fs24 
 at an unsuspecting enemy). With a supply of defensive spells, a transmuter can assume many of the functions of an abjurer. A transmuter with }{\i\fs24 spider climb, deeppockets}{\fs24 , and }{\i\fs24 knock}{\fs24  is a good substitution for a thief; add 
}{\i\fs24 polymorph self}{\fs24  and }{\i\fs24 passwall}{\fs24 , and you'd be hard-pressed to find a better spy. The transmuter always runs the risk of bei
ng overwhelmed by the sheer volume of available spells and making haphazard or ill-informed decisions about which spells he learns and memorizes. Therefore, he must take care to balance his spell choices with the needs of his party. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Most Desirable Spells:}{\fs24  
\par \tab \tab Low-Level: Of the 1st-level spells, }{\i\fs24 burning hands}{\fs24  is a nice choice for an offensive spell since it has a longer range than }{\i\fs24 shocking grasp}{\fs24  and does more damage at higher levels. }{\i\fs24 Chromatic orb}{\fs24 
 is a better choice yet. With its reversible option, }{\i\fs24 enlarge}{\fs24  gives the transmuter a wealth of options and is particularly useful in combat since it affects damage rolls. }{\i\fs24 Fog cloud}{\fs24  and }{\i\fs24 pyrotechnics}{\fs24 
 both have two different forms, essentially giving the transmuter two spells for the price of one.}{\i\fs24  Fly}{\fs24  expands the transmuter's strategic options and is perhaps the best all-around low-level alteration spell. Both }{\i\fs24 slow}{\fs24 
 and }{\i\fs24 haste}{\fs24  can influence melee combat dramatically, since a number of subjects are affected at the same time.
\par \tab \tab Medium-Level:}{\i\fs24  Polymorph self}{\fs24  and }{\i\fs24 polymorph other}{\fs24  can disguise friendly characters, intimidate enemies, and in the case of }{\i\fs24 polymorph other}{\fs24 
, greatly enhance the party's chance of combat success, since the subject's Armor Class and attack routines can be improved by the spell. }{\i\fs24 Death fog}{\fs24  and }{\i\fs24 disintegrate}{\fs24  are powerful offensive spells, and }{\i\fs24 teleport}
{\fs24  is a first-rate mobility spell. Of the medium-level spells, there are none better than }{\i\fs24 Tenser's transformation}{\fs24 , assuming the transmuter has a dagger or staff at hand to take advantage of his increased attack effectiveness, and }{
\i\fs24 Mordenkainen's lucubration}{\fs24 , which gives the transmuter access to any 1st-level through 5th-level spell used in the previous 24 hours. 
\par \tab \tab High-Level: }{\i\fs24 Incendiary cloud}{\fs24  is a terrific offensive spell, and }{\i\fs24 shape change}{\fs24  and}{\i\fs24  time stop}{\fs24  are both helpful in a variety of situations. The most useful high- level spell is probably }{
\i\fs24 polymorph any object}{\fs24 , since it can duplicate the effects of many other spells, including }{\i\fs24 polymorph other, transmute rock to mud,}{\fs24  and }{\i\fs24 stone to flesh}{\fs24 . 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Ethos:}{\fs24  Wizards drawn to th
e specialty of alteration are typically curious, sharp-minded, and deeply analytical. Fascinated by putting things together and taking them apart again, they are natural tinkerers, more interested in objects than in people. 
\par \tab \tab Transmuters generally aren't 
prone to profound philosophic insights, as their minds are more attuned to how things work than how a society functions.  To a transmuter, a person is essentially a complicated, difficult-to-understand machine.  They are obsessive collectors, excellent sc
h
olars, and clear thinkers.  According to a transmuter, the only constant in the universe is change; concepts of good and evil are relative, dependent on existing conditions, and seldom permanent. Forces of good and evil are constantly at work on neutralit
y, but since good causes less disruption than evil, good is preferable.  Consequently, many transmuters are of good alignments. 
\par \tab \tab Eager to explore the world around them, transmuters are willing members of adventuring parties. They are loyal followers but r
eluctant leaders, since they have trouble making decisions based on instinct alone. Although loyal to their friends, they seldom establish close relationships. Married transmuters are few. 
\par \tab \tab Transmuters are most comfortable in large cities where they have
 access to a variety of supplies, consultants, and other resources for their studies. Most societies welcome transmuters, generally considering them to be emotionally distant but harmless eccentrics. Transmuters commonly earn their livings as teachers, ad
visors, inventors, and manufacturers of medicines, potions, and other preparations
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Conjuration/Summoning}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Description:}{\fs24  This school includes two different types of magic, though both involve bringing in matter from another place. Conjuration spells produc
e various forms of non-living matter. Summoning spells entice or compel creatures to come to the caster, as well as allowing the caster to channel forces from other planes. Since the casting techniques and ability requirements are the same for both types 
of magic, conjuration and summoning are considered two parts of the same school. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Specialist Name:}{\fs24  Conjurer. A specialist who has learned only summoning spells sometimes calls himself a summoner, but this is merely a matter of semantics and has no bearing
 on the specialist's abilities, restrictions, or effectiveness. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Allowed Races:}{\fs24  A wizard must have human blood to be a conjurer. Therefore, humans and half-elves can specialize in this school, but elves cannnot. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Ability Requirements:}{\fs24  A wizard must hav
e exceptional stamina to spend a lifetime casting conjuration and summoning spells, since he is at times tapping into his own life force in order to create conjured matter or lure summoned creatures. Therefore, a wizard must have a Constitution score of a
t least 15 to specialize in this school. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Saving Throw Modifiers:}{\fs24  All opponents modify their saving throws by -1 when attempting to save against a conjuration or summoning spell cast by a conjurer. A conjurer adds a +1 bonus when saving against conjuratio
n spells or attacks from creatures or forces created by summoning spells. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Bonus Spells and Acquired Powers:}{\fs24  A conjurer can memorize an extra spell at each spell level, providing that at least one of the memorized spells is from the school of conjuration
/summoning. When a conjurer reaches 17th level, he no longer requires any material components to cast conjuration and summoning spells. When a conjurer reaches 20th level, he gains the ability to instantly dispel creatures conjured by an opponent who has 
used a}{\i\fs24  monster summoning}{\fs24 
 spell or its equivalent. The conjurer can dispel up to 10 Hit Dice worth of creatures with this ability; only creatures with 5 HD or fewer are affected (therefore, the conjurer could dispel two 5 HD creatures or ten 1 HD creatures, 
but not a 6 HD creature). The conjurer can use this ability up to three times per day by pointing at the creatures to be affected and concentrating. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Oppositional Schools:}{\fs24  A conjurer cannot learn spells from the schools of greater divination and invocation/evocation. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Spell Analysis:}{\fs24 
 Although the conjurer doesn't have an excessive number of specialty spells from which to choose, spells of the conjuration/summoning school are among the most potent of all, comparable only to the school of necromancy in sheer power. 
\par \tab \tab Though useful in a wide variety of situations, conjuration/summoning spells are particularly effective in combat, since the majority of them are capable of inflicting damage. 
\par \tab \tab Generally, conjuration spells such as }{\i\fs24 Melf's acid arrow}{\fs24  inflict damage directly, while summoning spells, such as }{\i\fs24 monster summoning}{\fs24 
, use an intermediary force or monster to attack opponents. Direct attacks have the advantage of immediacy; }{\i\fs24 Melf's acid arrow,}{\fs24  for instance, is sent directly at its target. Indirect attacks 
using an intermediary have the advantage of versatility; giant rats summoned by }{\i\fs24 monster summoning I}{\fs24  can be directed to attack the stationary Opponent No. 1, then can be ordered to run down the fleeing Opponent No. 2. 
\par \tab \tab Many summoning attacks require the continual participation of the conjurer; he can't control his summoned creatures if he can't communicate with them. This is especially crucial with spells such as}{\i\fs24  conjure elemental,}{\fs24 
 where the summoned creature will turn on the conjurer if the conjurer breaks his concentration. 
\par \tab \tab Conjurers who learn a large number of spells to summon creatures are better in large parties; the more companions he has, the more protection he has available if a need arises for his comrades to run interference, helping to ensure 
that his concentration remains unbroken. When traveling, such conjurers should remain in the center of the party, traditionally the safest spot. As members of smaller parties, conjurers are more effective knowing a variety of conjuration/summoning spells,
 particularly those that inflict damage directly; a conjurer with only one or two companions may find it difficult-- and dangerous-- to cast }{\i\fs24 conjure elemental}{\fs24 . 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Most Desirable Spells:}{\fs24  
\par \tab \tab Low-Level:}{\i\fs24  Melf's acid arrow, summon swarm}{\fs24 , and }{\i\fs24 flame arrow}{\fs24  are excellent offensive spells, but }{\i\fs24 monster summoning I}{\fs24 
 is the prize -- a clever conjurer should find numerous uses for, say, eight giant rats. 
\par \tab \tab Medium-Level: The monster summoning spells are the best. }{\i\fs24 Conjure elemental, Mordenkainen's faithful hound}{\fs24 , and }{\i\fs24 summon shadow}{\fs24  can turn the tide in just about any battle with low or medium level opponents. 

\par \tab \tab High-Level: This group includes what most wizards consider to be the most prized spell of any school, }{\i\fs24 wish}{\fs24 . }{\i\fs24 Limited wish}{\fs24  is nearly as potent. 
\par \tab \tab Because DMs vary widely in how they handle wishes, players with conjurer characters might want to discuss with their DM his parameters for adjudicating these types of spells. (See the Spell Commentary section in Chapter 7 for more about }{
\i\fs24 wishes}{\fs24 .)  In addition to wishes, high-level conjuration/summoning spells offer the conjurer some extremely powerful offensive spells. The all-around best in combat are }{\i\fs24 power word, kill; prismatic sphere}{\fs24 ; and the }{
\i\fs24 monster summoning}{\fs24  spells. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Ethos:}{\fs24  Because of the great power they wield, most conj
urers are utterly convinced that their specialty is superior to all others. Illusion and divination are trivial, alteration and invocation are inconsequential, abjuration and enchantment are too weak, and necromancy is too repulsive. Though tending toward
 smugness and arrogance, conjurers are also confident, courageous, and bright. 
\par \tab \tab Conjurers tend to rely on summoned creatures to perform difficult tasks for them; hence, many conjurers grow flabby as the years pass. Many consider conjurers to be downright lazy. 
\par \tab \tab Conjurers recognize the importance of keeping evil in check, and most are of good alignment. Evil conjurers flourish, however, particularly those who maintain contact with evil entities summoned from other planes of existence. 
\par \tab \tab Conjurers speak t
heir minds freely and have little patience for the opinions of those they consider to be inferior; it takes a leader of proven worth and unyielding strength to earn the respect of a conjurer. In an adventuring party, conjurers tend to prefer action to dis
cussion, and attacking to negotiating. Conjurers relish every opportunity for combat in order to demonstrate their power. \tab 
\par \tab \tab Since conjurers have little interest in associating with common people, they prefer to live in isolated areas of the countryside. Most consider children a nuisance, so even the few conjurers who marry typically remain childless by choice. 

\par \tab \tab Aside from magical research, conjurers shun all activities that would normally constitute a career or occupation. When funds are low, conjurers can always summon creatures to fetch treasure for them
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Enchantment/Charm}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Description:}{\fs24  Similar to the school of conjuration/summoning, this school encompasses two general types of spells. Both types imbue their subjects with magical energy to create specific effects. }{\i\fs24 Charm}{\fs24 
 spells induce changes or influence the behavior of creatures, usually altering their subject's mental or emotional states. Enchantment spells invest non-living objects with magical powers. Neither }{\i\fs24 charm}{\fs24  nor }{\i\fs24 enchantment }{
\fs24 spells have any effect on their subject's physical form. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Specialist Name:}{\fs24  Enchanter. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Allowed Races:}{\fs24  Humans, half-elves, and elves can all become enchanters. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Ability Requirements:}{\fs24  Since influencing the will of others is in part a manifestation of the caster's personal charm, a wizard must have a Charisma of at least 16 to specialize as an enchanter. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Saving Throw Modifiers:}{\fs24  All opponents modify their saving throws by -1 when attempting to save against an enchantment/charm spell cast by an enchanter. An enchanter adds a +1 bonus when saving against enchantment/charm spells. 

\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Bonus Spells and Acquired Powers:}{\fs24  An enchanter can memorize an extra spell at each spell level, providing that at least one of the memorized spells is from the school of enchantment/charm. Whe
n an enchanter reaches 17th level, he acquires immunity to all forms of }{\i\fs24 charm}{\fs24 
 spells. When an enchanter reaches 20th level, he gains the ability to cast a special free action spell once per day. The enchanter can cast this spell on himself or any creature 
he touches. No material components are required for this spell and the casting time is 1; the enchanter merely touches the subject to be affected and concentrates. When enchanted with }{\i\fs24 free action}{\fs24 
, the subject is able to move and attack normally for one hour, even under the influence of a spell that impedes movement such as }{\i\fs24 web}{\fs24  or }{\i\fs24 slow}{\fs24 . The spell negates the effects of }{\i\fs24 hold}{\fs24 
 spells. Underwater, the subject moves at normal surface speed and inflicts full damage with weapons, provided that the weapon is wielded and not hurled. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Oppositional Schools:}{\fs24  An enchanter cannot learn spells from the schools of invocation/evocation and necromancy. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Spell Analysis:}{\fs24  The enchanter has a moderate number of spells from which to choose, most of them emphasizing defensive ra
ther than offensive effects. Not only can this school of spells be divided into charms and enchantments, the spells can also be divided into those that affect only a single person or object, and those capable of affecting a group. 
\par \tab \tab Generally, the group-affecting spells are more useful to the enchanter, but he must consider their ranges and durations when deciding which spells to learn and memorize. For instance, both }{\i\fs24 ray of enfeeblement}{\fs24  and}{\i\fs24 
 Tasha's uncontrollable hideous laughter }{\fs24 are 2nd-level enchantment/charm spells that inflict penalties on the attack and damage rolls of opponents.}{\i\fs24  Ray of enfeeblement}{\fs24  affects only one creature, while }{\i\fs24 Tasha's laughter}{
\fs24  affects all those within a 30-foot cube. But note that even though}{\i\fs24  Tasha's laughter}{\fs24  inflicts a higher damage penalty, it lasts only a single round (although the effects essentially carry over into the next round). }{\i\fs24 
Ray of enfeeblement}{\fs24  lasts 1 round/level; when cast at higher levels, this spell can be extremely debilitating. And though the 60-yard range of }{\i\fs24 Tasha's laughter}{\fs24 
 makes the range of ray of enfeeblement look dismal by comparison (10 yards + 5 yards/level), note that at higher levels, the range of}{\i\fs24  ray of enfeeblement}{\fs24  increases dramatically, while the range of }{\i\fs24 Tasha's laughter}{\fs24 
 stays the same. 
\par \tab \tab The short
coming of the enchantment/charm catalog is the lack of offensive spells. Only a handful of them are capable of inflicting damage. This usually defines the enchanter's role in an adventuring party as defensive. As with the abjurer, it should be noted that 
w
ith his low AC, the enchanter is extremely vulnerable to attacks. A bodyguard with a high AC or a lot of hit points is more of a necessity than a luxury for an enchanter. Unlike an abjurer, whose defensive spells operate more or less automatically, the en
chanter's defensive spells often require him to take an additional action after they are successfully cast. A }{\i\fs24 hypnotized}{\fs24  victim, for instance, needs to be told what to do, as does a subject affected by }{\i\fs24 suggestion}{\fs24 . }{
\i\fs24 Charmed }{\fs24 creatures may simply stand and stare unless directed otherwise by the caster. Clearly, the most effective enchanters are those who are creative, quick-thinking, and vigilant. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Most Desirable Spells:}{\fs24  
\par \tab \tab Low-Level: Nearly all of the low- level enchantment/charm spells are defensive. The best are those that allow the enchanter the most latitude in the number of creatures he can affect, such as }{\i\fs24 hypnotism, sleep, scare,}{\fs24  and }{
\i\fs24 Tasha's uncontrollable hideous laughter}{\fs24 . Though it affects only one creature, }{\i\fs24 suggestion }{\fs24 can be an extremely useful spell 
in the hands of a creative caster; with a duration of 1 hour + 1 hour/level, it's also among the longest-lasting low-level spells. \tab \tab Medium-Level: }{\i\fs24 Enchanted weapon}{\fs24 
 is one of the few offensive spells available in this school, a valuable addition to any enchanter's repertoire. }{\i\fs24 Charm monster}{\fs24  and }{\i\fs24 hold monster}{\fs24  have the advantage of being able to affect a variety of opponents.}{
\i\fs24  Magic mirror}{\fs24  effectively substitutes for a }{\i\fs24 crystal ball}{\fs24  and other scrying devices.}{\i\fs24  Mass suggestion}{\fs24  and }{\i\fs24 eyebite}{\fs24  have the most possibilities
 of all the medium-level spells in the hands of a creative caster. 
\par \tab \tab High-Level: Unfortunately, few high-level enchantment/charm spells are available to the enchanter. For their variety of uses, }{\i\fs24 antipathy-sympathy, binding}{\fs24 , and}{\i\fs24  mass charm}{\fs24  are the best all
-purpose spells. In lieu of a conjurer, }{\i\fs24 demand}{\fs24  essentially functions as a conjuration spell. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Ethos:}{\fs24  With their high Charisma, enchanters tend to be the most physically attractive and personable of all the specialists. They are sensitive, passionate, and
 caring. They believe in the sanctity of life and share the druid's love of nature. Most enchanters see themselves as protectors of the helpless and advocates of the weak, but there are some who see their mastery of enchantment magic as evidence of their 
inevitable ascendance in the world. Notably, there are ample numbers of good and evil enchanters, but few neutral ones. 
\par \tab \tab Enchanters are commonly the voice of reason in adventuring parties. They are often able to devise options and solutions that have elud

those creatures. 
\par }{\b\fs24 \tab \tab Specialist Name:}{\fs24  Diviner.

\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Ability Requirements:}{\fs24  A wizard must have a strong intuition and exceptional willpower to master divination spells, reflected in a high Wisdom score. Specialists in this school must have a minimum Wisdom score of 16. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Saving Throw Modifiers:}{\fs24  All opponents modify their savi
ng throws by -1 when attempting to save against a divination spell cast by a diviner. A diviner adds a +1 bonus when saving against divination spells or any magical devices that duplicate these effects. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Bonus Spells and Acquired Powers:}{\fs24  A diviner can memorize an extra spell at each spell level, providing that at least one of the memorized spells is from the school of divination. 
\par \tab \tab When a diviner reaches 17th level, he acquires immunity to all forms of scrying spells, such as }{\i\fs24 ESP }{\fs24 and}{\i\fs24  know alignment}{\fs24 , as well as immunity against magical items that duplicate these effects. An opponent using
}{\i\fs24  ESP}{\fs24  on a 17th level diviner has no more success than if he were attempting to read the mind of a stone. An opponent using }{\i\fs24 clairaudience}{\fs24  on an unseen 17th level diviner ne
ither receives information nor becomes aware of the diviner's presence. 
\par \tab \tab When a diviner reaches 19th level, he receives the ability to cast a special }{\i\fs24 find traps}{\fs24  spell three times per day. The spell has an area of effect equal to a 10-foot-path up to a ra
nge of 30 yards. To cast the spell, the diviner must merely point in the desired direction and concentrate; no verbal or material components are required. Similar to the 2nd-level priest spell, }{\i\fs24 find traps}{\fs24 
 reveals the existence of all normally concealed mag
ical and mechanical traps, including alarms, glyphs, and similar spells and devices. The diviner learns the general nature of the trap (magical or mechanical) but not its exact effect or how to disarm it. 
\par \tab \tab When a diviner reaches 20th level, he receives the ability to cast a special }{\i\fs24 divination}{\fs24 
 spell once per day. To cast the spell, the diviner must concentrate for one full turn; no verbal or material components are required. Similar to the 4th-level priest spell, }{\i\fs24 divination }{\fs24 reveals a useful piece of advice
 concerning a specific goal, event, or activity that will occur within the next seven days. The revelation may take the form of an omen, a short phrase, or a cryptic verse, but it always reveals specific advice. In all cases, the DM controls the type of i
nformation revealed and whether additional }{\i\fs24 divinations}{\fs24  will supply additional information. The base chance for a correct }{\i\fs24 divination}{\fs24 
 is 80 percent, adjusted by the DM for unusual circumstances or extreme requests (such as a diviner trying to learn the exact 
location of a powerful artifact). If the dice roll fails, the diviner knows that the spell failed, unless specific magic yielding false information is at work. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Oppositional Schools:}{\fs24  The diviner is denied access to the school of conjuration/summoning. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Spell Analysis:}{\fs24 
 The variety of spells available to the diviner is more restricted than any other school or specialist.  Offensive spells -- that is, those that inflict damage on opponents either directly or indirectly -- are nonexistent for this school.  
Defensive spells that either inhibit an enemy's attack ability or provide direct protection for the diviner and his companions are likewise unavailable.  This doesn't mean that the diviner is useless on the battlefield; it means that his strength lies els
ewhere. 
\par \tab \tab 
As a gatherer of information, the diviner is without peer. A diviner can anticipate unexpected dangers, can separate the truth from lies, and is exceptionally effective as a spy. He can bolster his party's defenses by alerting them to the presenc
e of normally undetectable opponents. Although the repertoire of divination spells is relatively small, the diviner has access to more schools than any other specialist. 
\par \tab \tab There are two general groups of greater divination spells. One group includes spells that reveal information about a specific object or creature, such as}{\i\fs24  ESP}{\fs24  and }{\i\fs24 locate object}{\fs24 
. A second group reveals information about any type of object or creature within the range of the spell; this group includes }{\i\fs24 detect invisibility}{\fs24  and }{\i\fs24 clairvoyance}{\fs24 . 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Most Desirable Spells:}{\fs24 
\par \tab \tab Low-Level: All 1st-level through 4th-level divination spells are part of the lesser divination school, and are available to all schools. These are discussed in more detail in the Lesser Divination section below. However, a well-r
ounded diviner will have }{\i\fs24 detect magic, read magic,}{\fs24  and }{\i\fs24 ESP}{\fs24  included in his repertoire; }{\i\fs24 know alignment}{\fs24  and }{\i\fs24 clairvoyance}{\fs24  are also important basic divination spells. 
\par \tab \tab Medium-Level: All of the medium-level divination spells are strong, with }{\i\fs24 legend lore}{\fs24  and }{\i\fs24 true seeing}{\fs24  likely to get the most use.}{\i\fs24  Contact other plane}{\fs24 
 is a valuable spell if the diviner's party lacks a conjurer or other wizard capable of contacting extraplanar creatures. 
\par \tab \tab High-Level: With only a handful of high-level greater divination spells, the diviner has few choices. Note that }{\i\fs24 foresight}{\fs24  is one of the few divination spells that offers the diviner protection from harm. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Ethos:}{\fs24  Diviners are perhaps the wisest of all wizards. Their investigations into the world around them and their perusal o
f events of the past and the future empower them with a base of knowledge and insight rivaled only by the most learned scholars. A diviner typically possesses a striking insight into the workings of men's minds; few are better judges of character than div
iners. 
\par \tab \tab 
Diviners tend to be cautious and deliberate in their actions. Because their divinations have taught them that men are prone to hiding their true feelings and motivations, many diviners are suspicious and distrustful, sometimes to the point of cyni
cism. Those diviners who allow distrust and cynicism to overwhelm them tend to be of evil alignment. Those who accept man's ambiguous character as a part of the natural order tend to be of neutral alignment. Those who maintain faith in man's innate goodne
ss tend to be of good alignment.
\par \tab \tab Diviners are not predisposed to the adventuring life, and accept such a career only reluctantly. They are not natural combatants; in fact, wizards lacking in physical prowess are drawn to divination more than any other spe
cialty. Still, diviners make valuable additions to adventuring parties; their judgement, cunning, and plain common sense are welcome commodities. A party must take care to provide protection for diviners since they usually lack any significant ability to 
defend themselves. 
\par \tab \tab Diviners are loners at heart and do not make close friends easily. They rarely raise large families. Diviners of good alignment generally harbor no ill feelings against other people, and will usually assist them when asked. Still, they
 prefer to live alone in remote areas where they can conduct their research and investigation undisturbed. Stone towers on cliff sides or atop high hills are ideal residences for diviners. Though they show little interest in material possessions, diviners
 earn money by charging for their services as seers, fortune-tellers, and finders of lost objects and persons

\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Illusion}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Description:}{\fs24  Spells from the school of illusion bend reality to create apparent changes in the environment, in the caster, or in other
 persons or creatures. These spells do not cause real changes as alteration spells do, but instead alter the way that creatures and persons perceive reality. This school includes both illusion and phantasm spells (the differences are discussed in the Spel
l Analysis section below). 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Specialist Name:}{\fs24  Illusionist. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Allowed Races:}{\fs24  Humans and gnomes are eligible to become illusionists. It's not clear why elves and half-elves are unable to specialize in this school, though some speculate that the same inborn 
magical resistance that helps make them immune to charm spells also limits their ability to focus the magical energy needed to create illusions. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Ability Requirements:}{\fs24  The somatic components of most medium-level and high-level illusions require precise physical manipulations. Therefore, to specialize as an illusionist, a wizard must have a minimum Dexterity score of 16. 

\par }{\b\fs24 \tab \tab Saving Throw Modifiers:}{\fs24  Illusionists add a +1 bonus when rolling saving throws against any type of illusion. Opponents suffer a -1 pen
alty when rolling saving throws against illusion/phantasm spells cast by an illusionist. These modifiers are only used against illusions where saving throws are applicable. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Bonus Spells and Acquired Powers:}{\fs24  An illusionist can memorize an extra spell at each spell level, providing that at least one of the memorized spells is from the school of illusion. 
\par \tab \tab When an illusionist reaches 18th level, he adds a +1 bonus when saving against illusions cast by non-illusionists. (Since this is in addition to his natural +1 modifier, his saving throw bonus against these attack forms effectively becomes +2.)

\par \tab \tab When an illusionist reaches 20th level, he acquires the ability to cast a special }{\i\fs24 dispel illusion}{\fs24  spell three times per day. The spell has a range of 30 yards a
nd a casting time of 1. To cast this spell, the illusionist merely points at the subject and concentrates; no somatic or material components are required. This spell enables the illusionist to dispel any type of }{\i\fs24 phantasmal force}{\fs24 
, including those augmented by }{\i\fs24 audible glamer}{\fs24 ; however, }{\i\fs24 dispel illusion}{\fs24  is effective only on }{\i\fs24 phantasmal force}{\fs24  spells cast by non-illusionists. 
\par \tab \tab }{\i\fs24 Dispel illusion}{\fs24  has a base chance of success of 50 percent. For each level of experience that the illusionist exceeds the caster of the}{\i\fs24  phantasmal force}{\fs24 
, the chance of success is increased by 5 percent. For each level the caster exceeds the illusionist, the chance is reduced by 5 percent. (For instance, if a 20th-level illusionist attempts to dispel a}{\i\fs24  phantasmal force}{\fs24 
 created by a 15th-level mage, the illusionist's chance of success is 75 percent.) If an illusionist casts }{\i\fs24 dispel illusion}{\fs24 
 at a subject that isn't an illusion, there is no effect, but the attempt counts against the illusionist's daily limit of }{\i\fs24 dispel illusion}{\fs24  spells. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Oppositional Schools:}{\fs24  An illusionist cannot learn spells from the schools of necromancy, invocation/evocation, and abjuration. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Spell Analysis:}{\fs24  Spells of this school can be grouped into two general categories: illusions and phantasms. Illusions are spells that simulate reality, creating artificial conditions of light, color, sound, and scent. }{\i\fs24 
Audible glamer}{\fs24  is an example of an illusion that simulates sound. In general, the lower-level illusions are of limited use in combat situations, providing neither direct prot
ection from damage nor the ability to inflict damage on opponents. Though most illusions create only the appearance of reality, some high-level spells tap extradimensional forces to create illusions with physical substance, capable of inflicting damage an
d
 otherwise interacting with the real world. Shadow monsters is an example of a quasi-real illusion. These are the most useful types of illusion spells in combat, as they can create illusionary creatures to attack opponents and execute an assortment of oth
er tactical actions. Another type of illusion focuses extradimensional forces to alter the physical form of the caster. }{\i\fs24 Wraithform }{\fs24 
is an example. These are especially good defensive spells, as they protect the caster from a variety of attack forms. 
\par \tab \tab Phantasms are the second general group of illusion spells. Phantasms directly manipulate the perception of their victims. Phantasms do not create images, they induce responses. }{\i\fs24 Spook}{\fs24 
 is an example of a phantasm that induces the response of fear. Phantasms are also good defensive spells, more so than illusions that alter the caster's form, since they can affect a number of opponents within a given range. 
\par \tab \tab Because spells from the school of illusion are mainly concerned with the creation of images and are of limi
ted use on the battlefield, many feel that illusionists are the weakest of all the specialists. In a broad sense, however, no school provides a wizard with more options, since in most cases, illusion spells are limited only by the caster's imagination. Fo
r instance, consider the 1st-level illusion spell }{\i\fs24 phantasmal force}{\fs24 
. A dull-witted wizard might consider this a useless spell; after all, its illusions have only visual components. A silent monster might scare away a nervous bandit, but what else can you do 
with it?  Plenty, answers the creative illusionist, and the effects aren't confined to the battlefield. Here are some examples:

The party is being pursued by a hoard of orcs. The wizard uses}{\i\fs24  phantasmal force}{\fs24  to create the illusion of a wall of bramble bush

Spook, invisibility, wraithform,}{\fs24  and }{\i\fs24 invisibility, 10' radius}{\fs24  are excellent defensive spells. 
\par \tab \tab Medium-Level: With access to 4th-level and higher spells, the illusionist becomes a strong combatant, as he can take advantage of powerful, quasi-real illusions such as }{\i\fs24 
phantasmal killer, shadow monsters, demi-shadow monsters, shadow magic, demi-shadow magic}{\fs24 , and }{\i\fs24 shades}{\fs24 . The options for the creative illusionist also expand, with access to the complex creations possible with }{\i\fs24

\par \tab \tab High-Level: Unfortunately, the number of spells available to the illusionist drops dramatically at higher levels. }{\i\fs24 Shadow walk}{\fs24

can be the most deadly of all the offensive illusion spells. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Ethos:}{\fs24  Illusi
onists tend to be flamboyant, outgoing, and self-assured. Remarkably creative, they enjoy art, literature, poetry, and music, and many are accomplished artists in their own rights. Though their aptitude for scholarly pursuits is as high as any other speci
alist, illusionists tend to spend less time involved in research, preferring the company of people to the isolation of the laboratory. 
\par \tab \tab Illusionists have sharp minds, but they are not particularly deep thinkers. Pragmatic by nature, they accept the imperm
anence of all things, believing that any attempt at developing an all- encompassing philosophy to explain the meaning of existence is ultimately futile and therefore a waste of time. Illusionists tend to be of good and neutral alignments, since wizards in
clined toward evil usually opt for a specialization they perceive as being more powerful.
\par \tab \tab Because of their forceful personalities and sharp minds, illusionists make good leaders of an adventuring party, but they also make equally good lieutenants and stra
tegists. Because low-level and medium-level illusionists usually lack defensive spells, a party must provide bodyguards or other protection to keep them healthy; such illusionists are best kept in the center of the party when traveling. 
\par \tab \tab Illusionists enj
oy the hustle and bustle of urban life, and usually maintain well-furnished homes in the heart of a city. They usually have a host of friends and acquaintances, and are loyal and loving spouses. Illusionists earn a living as entertainers, artists, mercena

n/evocation. When an invoker reaches 17th level, he gains an additional +1 bonus when saving against invocation/evocation spells or against magical devices duplicating the effects of these spells. With his natural saving throw modifier, this effectively r
aises his bonus to +2.  When an invoker reaches 20th level, he gains another +1 bonus when saving against invocation/evocation spells, effectively raising his bonus to +3. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Oppositional Schools:}{\fs24  The invoker is denied access to spells from the schools of enchantment/charm and conjuration/summoning. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Spell Analysis:}{\fs24  This school offers the specialist a range of spells of staggering power. In fact, no school has a wider variety of offensive spells available at all levels. 
\par \tab \tab The high-level offensive evocation spells are nothing short of devastating; a single }{\i\fs24 meteor swarm}{\fs24 
 for instance, can inflict up to 160 hit points of damage. Accordingly, an invoker can be thought of as the wizardly equivalent of the mightiest fighter; when armed with a repertoire of invoca
tion/evocation spells, the invoker is easily among the game's most powerful characters. 
\par \tab \tab The invoker also has access to a number of potent defensive spells. Some of these provide protection against specific types of attacks, such as }{\i\fs24 shield }{\fs24 and }{\i\fs24 fire shield}{\fs24 
, while others offer protection by hindering the actions of all enemies within the range of the spell, such as }{\i\fs24 wall of fog}{\fs24  and }{\i\fs24 shout}{\fs24 
. Generally, the spells hindering enemy actions will prove to be more useful than spells protecting against a specific type
 of attack, unless the invoker suspects that he will be encountering specific types of monsters. For instance, if fire lizards roam the land, it's prudent to memorize }{\i\fs24 fire shield. 
\par }{\fs24 \tab \tab A wise invoker realizes that the strongest spells are not necessarily the
 best ones. For instance, assume that a 10th-level invoker and his party are about to venture into an unknown area where large numbers of hostile creatures are rumored to live. Though the creatures are numerous, they're also rumored to be low-level, perha
ps no more than 3 HD each. The invoker has both }{\i\fs24 lightning bolt}{\fs24  and }{\i\fs24 Melf's minute meteors}{\fs24  in his spell book -- which of the two will be the most helpful? The damage caused by a single }{\i\fs24 lightning bolt}{\fs24 
 exceeds that of }{\i\fs24 minute meteors}{\fs24 , but the }{\i\fs24 lightning bolt}{\fs24  can be used only once, while}{\i\fs24  minute meteors}{\fs24 
 enables the invoker to make up to ten attacks.  A typical 3 HD monster has about 12 hit points. Undoubtedly, the lightning bolt will wipe out a 3 HD monster, but much of the lightning bolt's power is likely to wasted
. With luck, the minute meteors will disable numerous 3 HD monsters. 
\par \tab \tab It is wise to memorize powerful single-shot offensive spells (such as }{\i\fs24 lightning bolt}{\fs24  and }{\i\fs24 fireball}{\fs24 ) when the party expects to encounter high-level monsters, and to memorize multiple-shot spells (such as }{
\i\fs24 chain lightning}{\fs24  and }{\i\fs24 Melf's minute meteors}{\fs24 ) capable of disabling a number of opponents when low-level monsters are expected. 
\par \tab \tab Though the invoker wields great power, it's important to remember that his Armor Class is no better than that of any other specialist. An invoker armed with}{\i\fs24  lightning bolt, fireball}{\fs24 
, and a range of other formidable offensive spells is still vulnerable to attacks. A party who repeatedly sends their invoker on dangerous assignments alone or an invoker who consistentl
y volunteers for such assignments is tempting fate; a single trap or successfully executed ambush can easily mean the end of his life. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Most Desirable Spells:}{\fs24 
\par \tab \tab Low-Level: }{\i\fs24 Magic missile}{\fs24  is the most potent 1st-level offensive spell. }{\i\fs24 Fireball, lightning bolt,}{\fs24  and }{\i\fs24 Melf's minute meteors}{\fs24 
 are killers, perhaps the best low-level offensive spells of any school. }{\i\fs24 Wall of fog}{\fs24  and }{\i\fs24 web }{\fs24 are the best low-level offensive spells. \tab 
\par \tab \tab Medium-Level: There are three medium-level spells whose multiple forms make them particularly attractive; interestingly, they all are all cold-based spells. These include }{\i\fs24 ice storms}{\fs24  (two forms), }{\i\fs24 wall of ice}{\fs24 
 (three forms), and}{\i\fs24  Otiluke's freezing sphere}{\fs24  (three forms). }{\i\fs24 Dream}{\fs24  is a similarly attractive spell, since the invoker also gains access to its reverse, }{\i\fs24 nightmare}{\fs24 . }{\i\fs24 Shout, wall of iron}{\fs24 
, and }{\i\fs24 Tenser's transformation}{\fs24  are all effective as both offensive and defensive spells. }{\i\fs24 Cloudkill }{\fs24 and }{\i\fs24 chain lightning }{\fs24 are excellent additions to any invoker's arsenal. 
\par \tab \tab High-Level:}{\i\fs24  Limited wish}{\fs24  is limited only by the imagination of the caster and the parameters set by the DM (see the discussion of wish spells in Chapter 7 for more information). }{\i\fs24 Binding,}{\fs24 
 with its six different forms, is a terrific defensive spell. All but the mightiest of opponents will yield to an invoker armed with one or more of the following: }{\i\fs24 Bigby's clenched fist, incendiary cloud, Bigby's crushing hand, energy drain, }{
\fs24 and }{\i\fs24 meteor swarm}{\fs24 . 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Ethos:}{\fs24  The school of evocation/invocation attracts the most serious-minded, intense, and determined wizard
s. Most are single-mindedly devoted to the mastery of their craft. Invokers of good alignment devote themselves to using their skills to promote goodness and eliminate evil, willing to sacrifice their lives if necessary. For evil-aligned invokers, the mag
ic of invocation is the key to their ascendancy; to them, good is weakness and evil is strength. Because specialists of this school are men and women of extreme philosophies, invokers of neutral alignment are rare. \tab 
\par \tab \tab Invokers are natural leaders: fearless
, inspiring, and authoritative. Their courage on the battlefield is without peer, and they perform as aggressors alongside the most able fighters. Since they are introspective, soft-spoken, and emotionally distant, invokers seldom establish strong persona
l relationships. 
\par \tab \tab Invokers will live anywhere they can maintain their privacy. Common people willingly leave them alone, fearing their power and even regarding them as dangerous, and invokers do little to dispel this reputation. They shun material possess
ions, needing only enough funds to finance their research. They primarily earn money as teachers, though they will occasionally sign on as members of adventuring parties in order to find treasure

\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Bonus Spells and Acquired Powers:}{\fs24  A necromancer can memorize an extra spell at each spell level, providing that at least one of the memorized spells is from the school of necromancy. When a necromancer reache
s 17th level, he adds another +1 bonus when saving against necromancy spells or against any attacks made by undead creatures. With his natural +1 bonus, this effectively raises his saving throw bonus to +2. 
\par \tab \tab When a necromancer reaches 20th level, he gains the ability to cast a special form of}{\i\fs24  speak with dead}{\fs24 
 once per day. To cast the spell, the necromancer must merely point to the subject and concentrate for one round; no verbal or material components are necessary. The spell enables the necromancer to as
k questions of a single dead creature and receive answers according to the knowledge of that creature. The creature can not have died more than 100 years ago, and the caster must be able to converse in a language that the dead creature formerly used. The 
necromancer can converse with the dead creature for one full turn and can ask up to four questions. 
\par \tab \tab Regardless of the creature's level or alignment, it receives no saving throw against this spell. However, the creature will be as evasive as possible, tending to give brief and sometimes cryptic answers. 
\par \tab \tab Additionally, the creature's knowledge is usually confined to what it knew in life (it cannot convey information about what may have happened to it after its death). 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Oppositional Schools:}{\fs24  The necromancer cannot learn spells from the schools of illusion and enchantment/charm. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Spell Analysis:}{\fs24  Though the school of necromancy has a relatively small number of spells, they are among the most potent available to any of the specialists. In terms of sheer po
wer, the necromantic spells compare to those from the school of invocation/evocation. 
\par \tab \tab Necromantic spells can be sorted into three general groups. One group includes spells that imbue the caster or a person of the caster's choice with special abilities similar to the effects of certain enchantment and alteration spells. }{\i\fs24 
Chill touch, enervation, death spell}{\fs24 , and }{\i\fs24 finger of death}{\fs24  are examples of this type of spell. The majority of this group are extremely powerful offensive spells; }{\i\fs24 death spell}{\fs24  and }{\i\fs24 finger of death}{\fs24 
 in particular are effective against a wide range of opponents. A necromancer armed with a repertoire of these spells bolsters his party's offensive capabilities considerably. }{\i\fs24 Reincarnation}{\fs24 
 can be considered part of this group, since it imbues the subject with a special ability; namely, a second chance at life. 
\par \tab \tab A second group of necromancy spells includes those that create creatures or physical forces to fight on the caster's behalf.  }{\i\fs24 Spectral hand}{\fs24  and }{\i\fs24 animate dead}{\fs24  are examples.  }{\i\fs24 Summon shadow}{\fs24  is al
so included in this group, although in this case, an actual creature is summoned rather than created. Since these spells enhance the caster's ability to inflict damage on opponents, they can be considered offensive spells. 
\par \tab \tab A third group of necromancy spells enables the caster to affect the actions of other creatures, usually undead. }{\i\fs24 Hold undead, contagion,}{\fs24  and }{\i\fs24 control undead}{\fs24 
 are examples. Since these spells inhibit the attack capabilities of the affected creatures, they can be considered defensive spells, although in the case of }{\i\fs24 control undead}{\fs24 , the affected creatures can also be used to attack enemies. 

\par \tab \tab The majority of the necromancer's spells probably won't come from just one of these groups. More likely, he will acquire a number of spells from each of
 these groups over the course of his career. Though all of the necromancy spells are extremely powerful, in most cases, the offensive spells are his best choices, since their power has no parallel in spells from other schools (for instance, it would proba
bly take a 9th-level wish to duplicate the effects of a 6th-level }{\i\fs24 death spell}{\fs24 ). 
\par \tab \tab The necromancer doesn't exhibit much magical strength until he reaches the higher levels. A low-level necromancer of 6th level or lower might contribute little to a party's d
efensive or offensive capabilities. A low-level necromancer requires extra protection from his companions; he must also adopt a realistic attitude about his effectiveness in combat and avoid taking unnecessary risks. However, once the necromancer gains ac
cess to the middle-level and higher-level spells (at 6th-level and above), his capabilities increase at a rapid rate. He needs only to live long enough to get there. 
\par }{\b\fs24 \tab \tab Most Desirable Spells:
\par }{\fs24 \tab \tab Low-Level: The low-level spells are somewhat weak, although }{\i\fs24 chill touch, spectral hand,}{\fs24  and }{\i\fs24 vampiric touch}{\fs24  are all good offensive spells. }{\i\fs24 Hold undead }{\fs24 and }{\i\fs24 detect undead}{
\fs24  will be invaluable if the wizard or his party will be venturing into catacombs, burial grounds, or other places where such creatures are likely to be encountered. 
\par \tab \tab Medium-Level: All of the spells in this group are exceptionally strong. }{\i\fs24 Magic jar}{\fs24  and }{\i\fs24 reincarnation}{\fs24  are unique in their utilities, their powers comparable only to that of a }{\i\fs24 wish}{\fs24 . }{\i\fs24 
Death spell, enervation, summon shadow, animate dead,}{\fs24  and }{\i\fs24 contagion}{\fs24  all have a variety of uses on the battlefield. 
\par \tab \tab High-Level: There are only a few high-level necromancy spells, but all of them are extremely potent. }{\i\fs24 Control undead, finger of death,}{\fs24  and }{\i\fs24 energy drain}{\fs24  can make the mightiest opponents tremble. Wizards
 planning to employ}{\i\fs24  clone}{\fs24  should carefully consider the time it takes to use; though the casting time is only a single turn, it can take up to eight months for the clone to grow. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Ethos:}{\fs24  The necromancer exhibits a fascination with life and death that bor
ders on the obsessive. He is typically brooding, humorless, and withdrawn. Casual acquaintances consider him to be cold and hostile, but those who befriend the necromancer may come to know him as a caring, complex individual whose emotions run deep. The n
ecromancer can be a valued and trustworthy companion, but he is also prone to bouts of depression so extreme that it becomes difficult for him to interact with others to any meaningful degree. 
\par \tab \tab Continual exposure to forces associated with undead creatures
 can have a corrupting effect on wizards with even the slightest inclinations toward evil. Consequently, the number of evil-aligned necromancers is rumored to far outweigh the number of those of good alignment. Neutral necromancers are virtually non-exist
ent; in general, a necromancer either has a will strong enough to resist the lure of darkness, or he submits to the corruption and devotes himself to a life of evil. 
\par \tab \tab Befriending a necromancer will try the patience of even the most understanding character
. Since necromancers prefer solitude to companionship, and silence to conversation, it is little wonder that few of them have spouses; the best mate for a necromancer is another necromancer. 
\par \tab \tab In spite of their reticence, most good- aligned necromancers a
re unshakable in their determination to confront and extinguish evil and will join like-minded individuals to undertake these types of missions. Understandably, necromancers make poor leaders, but they are valuable additions to adventuring parties. Not on
l
y do necromancers wield unmatched power, their familiarity with the world's dark forces makes them virtually fearless. On the other hand, much to a leader's chagrin, a necromancer does not always follow orders automatically; a necromancer who disagrees wi
th his party's strategy may simply strike out on his own. 
\par \tab \tab Necromancers live as far from civilized regions as they can, establishing residences in ancient castles, deep caverns, or even abandoned crypts. They spend most of their time engaged in arcane research, reading, studying, and writing. 
\par \tab \tab Necromancers seldom have careers, though they occasionally earn money as teachers and mercenaries. High-level necromancers simply order undead creatures to fetch them treasure when funds are low

\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab \tab Mages cannot abandon their careers to become specialists. Once a wizard decides to become a mage, he must remain so for the duration of his career
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Specialists}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab \tab Any specialist can abandon his school, but only to become a mage. A specialist cannot become a specialist from a different school. A specialist's decision to abandon his school to become a mage is 
permanent -- under no circumstances can he again become a specialist of his original school. A specialist keeps all of the spell bonuses that he had prior to his conversion, but receives no more bonus spells after he abandons his school to become a mage. 
He loses all saving throw bonuses at the time of his conversion (for instance, he no longer receives a +1 bonus when making saving throws against spells of his former specialty that are cast by other wizards).

When attempting to learn a spell of his former specialty, he no longer receives a bonus (e.g., an illusionist who abandons his school no longer receives a +15 percent bonus when attempting to learn illusion spells).

\par \tab \tab Percent chance = 1/2 (base chance to learn a spell -15 percent)\tab 
\par 
\par \tab \tab For instance, a former necromancer with an Intelligence of 13 wants to learn an illusion spell. Since necromancy is one of the schools that was in opposition to his former school, his chance to learn the spell is 1/2 (55-15), which equals 20
 percent.

\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 A Word About Minor Schools}{\fs24  
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Lesser Divination
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab \tab The divination spells of 4th-level and below are collectively known as the school of lesser divination. Lesser divination is considered to be a minor school of magic; that is, wizards can't become specialists in lesser divination. 
\par \tab \tab The term "minor" is used informally in this context. It means that specialists from any school are allowed to learn and use these spells. Many of the lesser divination spells, such as }{\i\fs24 detect magic}{\fs24  and }{\i\fs24 read magic}{
\fs24  are basic to the practice of magic. Others, such as }{\i\fs24 identify, ESP}{\fs24 , and }{\i\fs24 know alignment}{\fs24 
 are vital to the basic repertoire of any specialist. Without access to the spells of lesser divination, a wizard's ability to function would be frustratingly limited, particularly at the lower levels. 
\par \tab \tab At first glance, the existence of the school of lesser divination would seem to reduce the role of the diviner; after all, no other school allows all specialists such easy access to their low-level spells. However, an examinat
ion of the requirements for all schools shows that only the conjurer has greater divination as an opposition school; every other specialist has access to the low-level divination spells. In practice, the existence of the minor school of lesser divination 
serves only to give the conjurer access to the low-level divination spells. 
\par \tab \tab Although all specialists can learn lesser divination spells, they cannot learn them any more easily or effectively than they can learn spells from schools other than their own. A
ll non-diviners learn lesser divination spells at a penalty of -15 percent on the Intelligence Table (Table 4, page 16}{\i\fs24  PHB}{\fs24 
); for instance, either a conjurer or an illusionist with an Intelligence of 15 has a 50 percent chance of learning any given lesser divination spell. 
\par \tab \tab All lesser divination spells are also considered to be part of the school of greater divination. Therefore, a diviner has a 15 percent bonus on the Intelligence Table to learn lesser divination spells; for instance, a diviner with an In
telligence of 15 has an 80 percent chance of learning any lesser divination spell. 
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 New Minor Schools}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab \tab Do other minor schools of magic exist? That's a decision for the DM. Depending on the DM's style and the parameters of his campaign, he could select a
 small group of spells and assign them to a minor school. For instance, a minor school of lesser illusions could include all illusions of 1st-level through 3rd-level. A minor school of lesser abjuration/necromancy could include all abjuration and necroman
cy spells of 1st level. 
\par \tab \tab To add color to the campaign rule, the DM might want to create a historical explanation for the existence of any new minor schools. It's possible, for instance, that the minor school of lesser illusions was created by the administ
ration of an academy of magic to accommodate students who lacked the aptitude to become full-fledged illusionists. The minor school of abjuration/necromancy might have been developed by an ancient clan of good-aligned wizards to help protect them from att
acks by a rival band of abjurers allied with a force of undead. 
\par \tab \tab All wizards, regardless of their specialty, should have access to the spells of any minor school. If he wishes, the DM may assign bonuses and penalties to the various specialists' chances of
 learning the spells of a related minor school. Some possibilities follow.

\par \tab \tab Careful judgement should always be exercised when adding new minor schools. Remember that the more access characters have to magic, the more powerful they
 become. And the more powerful the characters are, the harder it is for the DM to maintain play balance. In general, the following two guidelines should apply: 
\par {\pntext\pard\plain\f3 \loch\af3\dbch\af0\hich\f3 \'b7\tab}}\pard \fi-360\li600\nowidctlpar\tx-1440\tx-720\tx240\tx270\tx720{\*\pn \pnlvlblt\ilvl0\ls1\pnrnot0\pnf3\pnindent360 {\pntxtb \'b7}}\ls1\adjustright {\fs24 
A minor school should include only a handful of low-level spells, none of them higher than 4th-level. Four or five 1st-level spells, two or three 2nd-level spells, one or two 3rd-level spells, and one or two 4th-level spells are sufficient.

low the DM to put his own mark on the game.  Designing new magic schools is one of the DM's toughest jobs, but it can also be one of the most rewarding. 
\par \tab \tab This chapter presents a step-by-step procedure for creating schools of magic from scratch. We'll demonstrate the process by creating a brand new school right before your eyes the school of metamorphics. 
\par \tab \tab At the end of this book is a blank planning sheet. This may be copied to help you design your own new schools
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 The Basics of Creating Schools
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab \tab Before creating a school, following are a few general guidelines to keep in mind. 
\par \tab \tab }{\i\fs24 New schools should be unique.}{\fs24  A new magic school should not overlap any of the existing schools. Since the eight major schools cover a lot of ground and there are already hundreds of spells in the AD&D\'ae
 game, this is not as easy as it sounds. Not only should the DM avoid new magic schools whose spells duplicate the effects of existing spells, he should also avoid trespassing on the priest's territory. For instance, a school of m
agic focusing on healing spells isn't a good idea, since it conflicts with one of the priest's special areas. 
\par \tab \tab }{\i\fs24 A new school shouldn't be too powerful.}{\fs24  The existence of a school whose spells can destroy dragons, level cities, and render the caster invulne
rable makes it extremely difficult for the DM to maintain play balance. It's next to impossible for the DM to invent suitable challenges for wizards wielding that much power, ultimately making the game boring for all. The school of necromancy is about as 
powerful as any school should be. 
\par \tab \tab }{\i\fs24 A new school shouldn't be too weak.}{\fs24  On the other hand, players won't be interested in a school that doesn't offer them a measure of power comparable to what's available in the existing schools. The school of greater divi
nation is about as weak as any school should be. 
\par \tab \tab }{\i\fs24 A new school must be described precisely.}{\fs24  Magical effects are difficult enough to adjudicate when their definitions are detailed and specific. When they're indefinite and ambiguous, it's nearly impossible
 to make consistent rulings and avoid frustrating players
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Type of Magic}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab \tab The first step in designing a new school is to decide what type of magical energy will be wielded by the specialist and how that energy will manifest itself. The type of magic must
 be general enough to encompass a variety of spells and effects, but it also must be specific enough to differentiate it from existing schools. 
\par \tab \tab Before examining the specifics, consider the differences between the magic of wizards and the magic of priest
s. Though some duplication exists-- both have access to necromantic and summoning spells, for instance-- the way they acquire spells is strikingly different
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Priests vs. Wizards}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab \tab Priests are granted the use of spells by deities of specific mythoi. Each d
eity has authority over particular groups of concepts, forces, and things, and these groups are called spheres. A priest's allegiance to his deity gives him access to certain spheres of magic that reflect the deity's special interests. Consequently, the m
agic of each sphere tends to be quite specific; spells from the sun sphere, for instance, deal primarily with light and darkness, while spells from the healing sphere deal primarily with curing. 
\par \tab \tab Unlike the priest, a wizard isn't bound to a particular dei
ty, and therefore does not depend on a deity for his magical abilities. A wizard learns and masters his spells in much the same way that a professor learns and masters a particular science. This is why the wizard class is a function of Intelligence. Wizar
dly schools focus on general categories of magical energy and effects and encompass a wide variety of spells. 
\par \tab \tab To preserve the integrity of these differences between wizard magic and priest magic, any new wizard school should avoid focusing on magical eff
ects stemming from one particular condition or thing. Instead, the school should be concerned with the manipulation of general energies and forces
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Categories of Effects}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab \tab Confused? Consider the following. 
\par \tab \tab Just as electrical energy or mechanical energy
 can be harnessed to accomplish specific tasks, it is also possible to channel magical energy to accomplish specific results. But while electrical and mechanical energies are limited by physics and other natural sciences, magical energy knows no such mund
ane boundaries. Magical energies can be channeled to produce any of the following list of effects. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Transformation:}{\fs24  When this type of effect is produced, an object or condition is changed to give it different physical properties or new special abilities. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Creation:}{\fs24  When this type of effect is produced, an object or condition is created that did not previously exist. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Requisitioning:}{\fs24  When this type of effect is produced, an existing object or condition is summoned from a different location. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Paranaturalism:}{\fs24 
 This type of effect involves the manipulation of forces and phenomena that exist beyond the confines of the material world and the laws governing it. (This can also be considered a catch-all category that includes effects not covered in other catego
ries.)
\par \tab \tab All of the existing schools of magic can be assigned to these categories. 
\par \tab \tab The schools of alteration, enchantment/charm, and abjuration all involve Transformation. 
\par \tab The schools of illusion and invocation/evocation involve Creation. 
\par \tab \tab Conjuration/summoning involves Requisitioning. 
\par \tab \tab Divination and necromancy involve Paranaturalism. 
\par 
\par \tab \tab Although some overlapping occurs (for instance, magical energies that Requisition existing objects may Transform them as well), all magic schools channel magical energies to produce the effects defined in these four categories. 
\par \tab \tab What differentiates one school from another is the type of effects produced. For example, both illusion and invocation/evocation channel magical energy for Creation. However, illusions c
reate unreal objects and conditions; invocations create objects and conditions that cause direct physical effects
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Defining the Effects of a New School
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab \tab To begin the design of a new school, the DM must first define the type of effects it produces. Any de
finition is likely to be vague. But at this stage, it should be. Unlike the intentionally specific priestly sphere, a wizardly school must be general enough to accommodate a large variety of spells. \tab 
\par \tab \tab Use the steps that follow. 
\par \tab \tab 1. Choose one type of c
hannelled magical energy from the four categories described above: Transformation, Creation, Requisitioning, or Paranaturalism. If you know what type of school you plan to design, the choice of category probably will be obvious. If you do not yet have any
 ideas about your school, pick any of the categories-- it's a good place to start. (If your choice of categories seems less appropriate as your school develops, you can always pick another.)
\par \tab \tab 2. Define what specific type of effects these channelled energie
s will produce. If it is a Transformation school, what types of things or conditions will be transformed? If it is a Paranaturalism school, what type of paranatural energies or forces will be involved.
\par \tab \tab 3. Ensure that the definition of the new school does not resemble the definitions of existing schools too closely. Compare them with the school descriptions in Chapter 1.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 How It All Works}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab \tab To illustrate this procedure, a new school is created here. First, one of the categories of channelled energy is chosen. The school will involve changing one type of item into another, so the choice is the Transformation category.
\par \tab  Next, we define the type of Transformation effects the school will produce. This definition needs to be as clear as possible; writing down 
the definition in a sentence or two will put it on the right track. Our school will feature spells that cause an object or condition to change into a different but related object or condition. That description is vague, but good enough to get started. 

\par \tab \tab Is this school sufficiently different from existing schools? Our school sounds very similar to the school of alteration, so it needs some adjustments. Since many of the alteration spells imbue a creature with special abilities, such as }{
\i\fs24 water breathing}{\fs24  and}{\i\fs24  fly}{\fs24 
, we can decide that the spells from our school will deal with physical transformations only. Further, all of our physical transformations will be permanent (subject to the usual limitations, such as cancellation by }{\i\fs24 dispel magic}{\fs24 ). \tab 

\par \tab \tab Throughout the remainder of this chapter, we'll continue to develop this school as a demonstration
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Name of the School}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab \tab Once you have an idea for a school, it needs a name. If an obvious name doesn't suggest itself, as it did for the school of illusion, check a thesaurus f
or synonymous words or evocative phrases. Fantasy literature is another good source for names. 
\par \tab \tab Since our new school deals with change, we checked the thesaurus for synonyms and found }{\i\fs24 metamorphosis}{\fs24 , a word that is descriptive, has a nice scholarly ring t
o it, and even sounds a little mystical. We'll christen it the school of }{\i\fs24 metamorphics}{\fs24 . 
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Name of the Specialist}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab \tab Specialists usually derive their names from the names of their schools by changing the suffix. Thus, from }{\i\fs24 abjuration}{\fs24  comes the }{\i\fs24 abjurer}{\fs24 , and from }{\i\fs24 illusion}{\fs24  comes the }{\i\fs24 illusionist}{
\fs24 . Most of the time, this technique is satisfactory. 
\par \tab \tab However, some schools simply do not lend themselves to wizardly-sounding names. For instance, the word }{\i\fs24 alterer}{\fs24  is clumsy, so the school of alteration has opted for the less awkward }{\i\fs24 transmuter}{\fs24 
 for the name of their specialist. We have a similar problem with our school of metamorphics-- both }{\i\fs24 metamorphist}{\fs24  and }{\i\fs24 metamorpher}{\fs24  are clumsy. Returning to the thesaurus, we find the word }{\i\fs24 transfigure}{\fs24 
. We can call our specialist a }{\i\fs24 transfigurist}{\fs24 .

\par \tab \tab The most important part of creating a new school is designing new spells that are different enough to set it apart from existing schools. There must be enough new spells to provide the user a reasonable variety of options. At the sa
me time, duplication of existing spells should be avoided. Minor variations of existing spells should also be avoided. The spell selection should be attractive enough so that novice wizards will consider specializing in it, but not so powerful that the sc
hool overwhelms all others
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Basic Spells
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab \tab A new school does not need an extensive number of spells immediately. Beginning with a core of basic spells is best, adding new spells as required by the campaign and the players. 
\par \tab \tab An acceptable core of basic spells includes the number of spells for each level given in Table 1. Note that this is approximately the number of spells for the schools of greater divination and necromancy given in the}{\i\fs24  Player's Handbook}
{\fs24 . If the DM is unable to invent this number of spells, he should concentrate on designing spells to fill the lower levels (levels 1-3) so his lower-level specialists can begin their careers

\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Adapting Existing Spells}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab \tab Before attempting to design new spells, first look at the existing spells for other schools. Notice that a number of spells listed in the }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook}{\fs24  belong to more than one school; }{\i\fs24 rainbow pattern}{\fs24 
, for instance, belongs to the schools of alteration and illusion, while}{\i\fs24  limited wish}{\fs24  belongs to conjuration/summoning and invocation/evocation. Do any of the }{\i\fs24 PH}{\fs24 
 spells (or any of the new spells listed in Chapter 8 of this book) seem appropriate for your new school? The alteration spells }{\i\fs24 transmute rock to mud}{\fs24  and}{\i\fs24  transmute water to dust}{\fs24 
 are perfect for our school of metamorphics-- they both cause one substance to change to another, they both cause physical changes, and in both cases the effects are permanent. 
\par \tab \tab There are other likely candidates from the }{\i\fs24 PH }{\fs24 spells for our school, but using an excessive number of duplicate spells (more than two or three) compromises the individuality of a new school. 
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Ideas for New Spells
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab \tab The DM and players will ne
ed to brainstorm for ideas that will eventually be developed to fill in the basic spell list. Although the DM makes the final decisions when designing spells for a new school, the contributions and ideas of the players are important. Fantasy literature is
 
another good source of ideas, as are the abilities of magical monsters and functions of magical devices. The DM and his players might also discuss encounters or battles from previous adventures and decide what types of spells would have been useful for th
e wizards. 
\par \tab \tab The DM (with the assistance of the players) should then assign a spell name to each idea and decide the general effects of the potential spells. The names of the spells should be brief and descriptive. The effects can be approximate at this po
int-- they'll be refined later. We do not have the space here to develop a full range of spells for our metamorphics school, but here are three potential spells we'll use as examples: 
\par \tab \tab }{\i\fs24 Evaporate:}{\fs24  This spell changes liquids into gases. 
\par \tab \tab }{\i\fs24 Blood to dust:}{\fs24  This spell changes an opponent's blood to dust, instantly killing him. 
\par \tab \tab }{\i\fs24 Improved armor:}{\fs24  This spell changes a companion's armor to a better Armor Class
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Checking for Duplication}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab \tab Each potential spell should be checked against the spells in the }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook}{\fs24  to see if it already exists. Considering that the }{\i\fs24 PH}{\fs24 
 lists hundreds of spells, re-inventing an existing spell is easy. A DM need not be obsessive about this; a large number of existing spells inflict damage or add bonuses and penalties to saving th
rows. As long as the new spell has a unique twist of its own, it can be deemed acceptable. 
\par \tab \tab Of our examples, we notice that }{\i\fs24 blood to dust}{\fs24  is superficially similar to the 7th-level }{\i\fs24 finger of death}{\fs24  spell, since they both instantly take a victim's life. But
 the methods of achieving this effect are distinctly different; }{\i\fs24 blood to dust}{\fs24  changes the victim's blood to an inert substance, while }{\i\fs24 finger of death }{\fs24 snuffs out the victim's life force. Further, }{\i\fs24 blood to dust}
{\fs24  is only effective on victims with blood in their veins.}{\i\fs24  Blood to dust}{\fs24  is different enough to stand on its own. 
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Checking for Play Balance}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab \tab After checking them against existing spells, all potential spells of a new school must be considered for play balance. Imagine that the wizard employs a particul
ar spell every day-- will constant use have any significant long-term effects on the balance of the game? 
\par \tab \tab Consider our potential metamorphic spells. }{\i\fs24 Evaporate}{\fs24  won't have any profound effects on the game, assuming it has reasonable limitations (for instance, evaporating an entire ocean should be prohibited). At best, }{\i\fs24 
blood to dust}{\fs24  means one less opponent per day.
\par \tab  But }{\i\fs24 improved armor}{\fs24  presents a problem. Since our metamorphic spells are permanent, wouldn't a transfigurist immediately improve all of his par
ty's armor as much as he could? Is this fair? We can't make the effects temporary, or we're violating the definition of our school. Let's throw out }{\i\fs24 improved armor}{\fs24  and invent another spell later.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Determining Effects and Levels}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab \tab Once the inappropriate spe
lls have been discarded, we need to define and describe the specific effects of the remaining spells, then assign them to levels. The description of a spell should cover its typical uses, but it is unnecessary-- and realistically, impossible-- to deal wit
h every possible application. More importantly, the description should cover the spell's limitations in detail; not only do precise limitations make spells easier to adjudicate, they are easier to assign to levels. 
\par \tab \tab Here are some points to consider when assigning limitations to spells: 
\par \tab \tab }{\i\fs24 How many subjects can be affected by the spell?}{\fs24  Generally, the more subjects affected, the higher the level of the spell (compare }{\i\fs24 invisibility}{\fs24  to }{\i\fs24 mass invisibility}{\fs24 , and }{\i\fs24 charm person
}{\fs24  to}{\i\fs24  mass charm}{\fs24 ). 
\par \tab 
\par \tab \tab }{\i\fs24 What type of subjects can be affected by the spell?}{\fs24  Subjects can be low-level or high-level (or low HD and high HD). They can also have specific characteristics (such as the subjects of }{\i\fs24 detect invisibility}{\fs24 
), or they can be general types with no specific characteristics (such as the subjects of }{\i\fs24 charm monster}{\fs24 ). Usually, higher-level spells are able to affect high-level (or high HD) subjects that have no specific characteristics-- }{\i\fs24 
finger of death}{\fs24  is a good example. 
\par 
\par \tab \tab }{\i\fs24 Are victims allowed a saving throw to avoid the effects of the spell?}{\fs24  Disallowing a saving throw for a spell that would normally have one usually boosts it to a higher level. For instance, the 5th-level}{\i\fs24  cone of cold}{
\fs24  allows a saving throw to reduce a victim's damage by half. If such a throw were not allowed, the spell would be significantly more dangerous and would belong in a higher level.  
\par \tab \tab }{\i\fs24 If the spell causes damage, what is the maximum?}{\fs24   It would be grossly inappropriate for any 1st-level spell to inflict 100 hit points of damage. Similarly, a 9th-level spel
l should be capable of inflicting a significant amount of damage. Table 2 suggests the maximum amount of damage a spell of a particular level should be allowed to inflict on a single enemy. These figures are general guidelines only, and can be altered by 
any number of variables. For instance, if a hypothetical 3rd-level}{\i\fs24  flying sword}{\fs24  spell has only a 10 percent chance of hitting its target, its maximum amount of damage could be justifiably higher than 3-18 hit points. 
\par \tab \tab Remember that the inflicted damage of
 certain spells may vary according to the caster's level; for instance, fireball causes 1d6 hit points of damage per level of the caster. (Table 2 gives the damage for a spell cast at its base level; if our hypothetical}{\i\fs24  flying sword}{\fs24 
 spell is 3rd-level, but can be cast at higher levels to inflict more damage, Table 2 indicates the maximum amount of damage it can cause when cast at its lowest level. )

r of subjects destroyed and special restrictions on death. For instance, a 7th-level spell might destroy only a single subject, while a 9th-level spell could destroy several. A 7th-level spell might allow a saving throw, while a 9th-level spell might not.
 A 7th-level spell might allow}{\i\fs24  resurrection}{\fs24  attempts, a 9th-level spell might not. 
\par 
\par \tab \tab }{\i\fs24 If the spell causes damage, do victims get a saving throw?}{\fs24  Of the spells in the }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook}{\fs24 , many of them allow the victim to make a saving throw in order to reduce
 or eliminate the potential damage. Though it is unnecessary to allow saving throws in every case, this is a good way to add balance to what otherwise might be an especially dangerous spell. There are three options to consider. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 1. No saving throw.}{\fs24  This option maximizes a spell's lethality. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 2. Half damage.}{\fs24  This option means that the character suffers half-damage if his saving throw is successful. This is less lethal than a spell with no saving throw, but more lethal than the following option. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 3.}{\fs24  }{\b\fs24 Negate.}{\fs24  This option means that the character suffers no damage if his saving throw is successful. This is the least lethal option of all. 
\par \tab \tab Note that saving throws need not always be saving throws vs. spells; consider different types of saving throws for spe
lls of higher levels (in every case, however, only one type of saving throw should be allowed). A saving throw vs. spells is always an option, no matter what the level of spell, but here are some alternatives: 
\par {\pntext\pard\plain\f3 \loch\af3\dbch\af0\hich\f3 \'b7\tab}}\pard \fi-360\li600\nowidctlpar\tx-1440\tx-720\tx240\tx270\tx720\tx2136\tx3417{\*\pn \pnlvlblt\ilvl0\ls1\pnrnot0\pnf3\pnindent360 {\pntxtb \'b7}}\ls1\adjustright {\fs24

\par \tab \tab }{\i\fs24 If the spell is defensive, does it inhibit the enemy's ability to attack, or does it offer direct protection from damage?}{\fs24  Generally, spells that defend against a specific type of damage (such as }{\i\fs24 
protection from normal missiles}{\fs24 ) are less powerful than spells that protect against a general category of damage (such as }{\i\fs24 minor globe of invulnerability}{\fs24 ), and sp
ells that protect the caster or subjects of the caster's choice (such as }{\i\fs24 protection from evil}{\fs24 ) are less powerful than spells that inhibit the enemy's ability to attack (such as }{\i\fs24 wall of fog}{\fs24 
). The highest-level defensive spells tend to be those that get rid of the attacker (such as }{\i\fs24 dismissal }{\fs24 and }{\i\fs24 imprisonment}{\fs24 .)
\par \tab \tab If a DM has designed a defensive spell that he wants to modify so he can assign it to a higher level, he can do one or more of the following: 
\par {\pntext\pard\plain\f3 \loch\af3\dbch\af0\hich\f3 \'b7\tab}}\pard \fi-360\li600\nowidctlpar\tx-1440\tx-720\tx240\tx270\tx720\tx2136\tx3417{\*\pn \pnlvlblt\ilvl0\ls1\pnrnot0\pnf3\pnindent360 {\pntxtb \'b7}}\ls1\adjustright {\fs24 
Increase the types of damage against which it protects. (To assign the spell to a lower level, decrease the types of damage.) 
\par {\pntext\pard\plain\f3 \loch\af3\dbch\af0\hich\f3 \'b7\tab}}\pard \fi-360\li600\nowidctlpar\tx-1440\tx-720\tx240\tx270\tx720\tx2136\tx3417{\*\pn \pnlvlblt\ilvl0\ls1\pnrnot0\pnf3\pnindent360 {\pntxtb \'b7}}\ls1\adjustright {\fs24 
Increase the number of subjects the spell protects, usually by increasing the area of effect. (For a lower level, decrease the area of effect, or have the spell provide protection for only the caster.)  \tab

\par \tab \tab }{\i\fs24 Does the spell increase or decrease a subject's saving throw modifier?}{\fs24  Penalties and bonuses to the subject's saving throw alter the effectiveness of a spell. Consider again our hypothetical 3rd-level }{\i\fs24 flying sword}{
\fs24  spell. Assume that it inflicts 1-10 hit points of damage on subjects when used at night, and that a saving throw negates the damage. If the subject is allowed a +2 bonus, it might be more appropriate to assign }{\i\fs24 flying sword}{\fs24 
 to 2nd-level. Conversely, if no saving throw is allowed at all, the spell might belong at 4th-level. 
\par 
\par \tab \tab }{\i\fs24 Is the effect of the spell permanent?}{\fs24  Spells whose effects are temporary are less powerful than those whose effects are permanent. (Remember that few spells are literally permanent, since }{\i\fs24 dispel magic}{\fs24 
 negates their effects in most cases. A}{\i\fs24  limited wish}{\fs24  or }{\i\fs24 wish}{\fs24  can negate almost any spell. )
\par 
\par \tab \tab }{\i\fs24 What are the spell's duration, range, and area of effect?}{\fs24   Longer durations, ranges, and areas of effect translate into more powerful spells.  Adjusting t
hese elements is a good way to modify a spell to assign it to a higher or lower level.  For instance, if }{\i\fs24 flying sword}{\fs24 
 persists for only one round/level and has a range of 30 yards, it belongs in a lower level than if it persisted for one turn/level and had a range of 100 yards.  
\par \tab \tab There are no minimum or maximum requirements for durations, ranges, or areas of effect, as long as the DM stays within the bounds of reason.  For instance, a range of 1 mile/level sounds ridiculously high for }{\i\fs24 any }{\fs24 
1st-level spell.
  A good place to start for establishing durations, ranges, and areas of effect is 1 round/level (duration), 10 yards/level (range), and a 10-foot cube or one creature/level (area of effect).  Remember that these are general guidelines only, and are not a
ppropriate for every type of spell. Many spells have an effective range of 0, meaning they affect only the caster. Others affect only a touched subject. Those spells whose effects are permanent until negated have no set duration. For some spells, such as 
}{\i\fs24 extension}{\fs24 , area of effect is irrelevant. 
\par 
\par \tab \tab When the DM has finished defining the effects of a new spell and has assigned it to a level, the spell should be compared to the existing spells of that level. If the new spell is clearly weaker or excessively mor
e powerful than spells from the same level, the DM should either assign it to a different level or make adjustments as suggested above to make it comparable. In general, the illusion and divination spells are the least powerful, and the necromancy and inv
ocation spells are the most powerful; a new spell should be checked against these first. 
\par 
\par \tab \tab Let's return to our two new spells for the school of metamorphics. }{\i\fs24 Evaporation}{\fs24  causes a quantity of water or other inorganic liquid to instantly turn to vapor, just
 as if the sun had evaporated it. It will not inflict any direct damage (evaporating the blood or other organic liquids of a creature is forbidden). }{\i\fs24 Evaporation }{\fs24 
is difficult to perceive as providing meaningful defense for a party. Evaporation is destined to be a low-level spell, probably 1st-level. 
\par \tab \tab Range? Most 1st-level spells have a range of 30-60 yards; since evaporation is relatively weak, we will give it a higher range of 60 yards. 
\par \tab \tab Area of effect? Most 1st-level spells affect an area of 10-30 yards (or 10-30 foot-radius, or 10-30 foot cube). In this case, we will give }{\i\fs24 evaporation}{\fs24 
 an area of effect of a 20-foot cube + 10-foot cube/level. (This makes the spell more powerful as the wizard increases in level.)
\par \tab \tab Checking our 1st-level evaporation spell against the existing 1st-level spells in the }{\i\fs24 PH}{\fs24 
 shows no major discrepancies. The definition of evaporation still needs more tightening. We need to determine whether it affects liquids concealed in containers, rain, quicksand, and lava, and other limitations it has. 
\par 
\par \tab \tab Looking at }{\i\fs24 blood to dust}{\fs24 
, it belongs in a higher level because it causes death. We will decide that blood to dust causes all of the blood of a single victim to turn to dust, instantly killing it. It is certainly not as powerful as a 9th-level spell (the 9th-level}{\i\fs24 
 power word, kill}{\fs24  can destroy several creatures at once); let's place it at 7th level and give it a range of 60 yards (comparable to other 7th-level spells). Checking the existing 7th-level spells, we discover}{\i\fs24  finger of death}{\fs24 
, a spell not unlike}{\i\fs24  blood to dust.}{\fs24   }{\i\fs24 Finger of death}{\fs24  is more powerful, since it can destroy any creature, even those without blood, but it also allows a saving throw. To balance }{\i\fs24 blood to dust}{\fs24 
 against other 7th-level spells, let's say that victims of }{\i\fs24 blood to dust}{\fs24  are not allowed saving throws. Further, undead, monsters from other planes, and monsters with more than 4 HD will be immune to }{\i\fs24 blood to dust.}{\fs24 
 With further adjustments (Can the affected subject be resurrected or raised? Can the corpse be animated to become a zombie?), we'll have a powerful but balanced 7th-level spell for the school of metamorphics
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Casting Times}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab \tab All spells must state their casting times. A guideline is to make the casting time equal to the level of the spell (a 7th-level spell has a cast
ing time of 7), but casting times of one or more rounds are also common. Complex spells might have casting times of one or more turns. Avoid short casting times for high-level spells and excessively long casting times for all but the most powerful spells.
 \tab 
\par \tab \tab We'll give our 1st-level evaporation spell a casting time of 1 and our 7th-level }{\i\fs24 blood to dust}{\fs24  a casting time of 1 round
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Components
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab \tab Every spell has one or more components. There are two ways to determine the components for a new spell:
\par \tab \tab 1. Locate existing spells from the }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook}{\fs24  that are similar to the new spell and assign similar components. For instance, }{\i\fs24 finger of death}{\fs24  is similar to our new }{\i\fs24 blood to dust}{\fs24 
 spell, so we'll decide that }{\i\fs24 blood to dust}{\fs24  has verbal and somatic components. 
\par \tab \tab 2.
 Assign the components randomly. If this sounds too arbitrary, consider that the components of a particular spell were likely determined by the wizard who originally researched it. A common assumption is that two wizards working independently could discov
er the same spell; it is unlikely that they used exactly the same components. For our }{\i\fs24 evaporation}{\fs24  spell, we'll use verbal, somatic, and material components, the most common combination. 
\par \tab \tab Instead of choosing a specific set of components for a new spell, you can determine them randomly by rolling 1d20 on Table 3. If you get a result that contradicts the conditions under which the spell is cast, roll again

cial restrictions on a new school, he should present justification for them. For instance, gnomes are restricted from specializing in our school of metamorphics. The reason? A thousand years ago in our campaign world, a brotherhood of transfigurist gnomes
 accidently developed a metamorphics spell that permanently transformed a city of gnomes into a field weeds. The gods were so upset by this carelessness that the transfigurist specialty has been forbidden to gnomes ever since.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Ability Requirements
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab \tab All characters must have an Intelligence score of at least 9 to become a wizard. A new school might require a higher Intelligence score for specialization, but only in the rarest circumstances should it be higher than 13. 
\par \tab \tab All specializations require a minimu
m score in a secondary ability. This minimum score should be at least 12, but no higher than 16. Wisdom, Constitution, and Dexterity are the most common secondary ability requirements, but Charisma and Strength are also possible. Remember that setting the
 ability requirements high will keep the number of specialists low, and vice versa. 
\par \tab \tab Because some of the somatic components for metamorphic spells require precise execution, we will set a minimum Dexterity score of 15 for specialists in the school of metamorphics
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Clothing}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab \tab Though none of the schools described in Chapter 1 have any specific dress requirements, a new school might require (or strongly suggest) that its specialists wear distinctive garb to indicate their status. 
\par \tab \tab Not all specialists of a 
school would necessarily adhere to this dress code. Perhaps only graduates of a particular academy would wear distinctive garb. Perhaps only 1st-level specialists would wear it. Perhaps it is worn only by high level specialists as a symbol of achievement.
 All such distinctions are the decision of the DM. Caution is advised-- obvious identifying garb can be a red flag to enemies who wish to wipe out the members of a particular school. 
\par \tab \tab Dress requirements are not restricted to items of clothing. Rings, pendants, anklets, and bracelets are all possibilities. Likewise, certain colors might symbolize graduates of a school, while other colors might be forbidden. 
\par \tab \tab For our metamorphics school, we will require that 1st-level transfigurists wear a red arm band to
 identify them as beginners. When a transfigurist reaches 10th level, he is allowed-- but not required-- to wear a red cloak to symbolize his competence

\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Experience Levels and Spell Progression}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab \tab All existing schools use the experience level progression and spell progression given on Tables 20 and 21 on page 30 of the }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook}{\fs24 
. New schools should use these, too. It is possible to devise new tables from scratch, but this creates considerable work for the DM, adding
 unnecessary complications and an increased chance of an unbalanced campaign. In any case, specialists should not be allowed to progress more quickly than the }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook}{\fs24  tables allow
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Hit Points}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab \tab All existing schools use 4-sided dice to determine 
their specialists' hit points. The power wielded by a specialist, especially in the higher levels, more than compensates for his relatively low number of hit points. If the specialist is too weak, consider creating more spells, adjusting the current spell
s to make them stronger, or giving him access to spells from more schools
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Languages}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab \tab All specialists use Table 4 on page 16 of the }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook}{\fs24  to determine the number of languages they can learn (in addition to their native tongue). Certain types o
f specialists may be able to exceed these limits. Eligible specialists might include those with exceptionally strong academic backgrounds or those who devote a large amount of their spare time studying new tongues. 
\par \tab \tab The types of effects created by a part
icular wizard might also suggest an extraordinary aptitude for languages; for example, wizards specializing in Transformation magic might not seem to have any particular affinity for languages, but those specializing in Creation might (since they're invol
ved in producing conditions that didn't previously exist, which could include communication skills). 
\par \tab \tab If a new specialist is to have exceptional language skills, keep the following guidelines in mind.
\par {\pntext\pard\plain\f3 \loch\af3\dbch\af0\hich\f3 \'b7\tab}}\pard \fi-360\li600\nowidctlpar\tx-1440\tx-720\tx240\tx270\tx720\tx2136\tx3417{\*\pn \pnlvlblt\ilvl0\ls1\pnrnot0\pnf3\pnindent360 {\pntxtb \'b7}}\ls1\adjustright {\fs24 
A new specialist should not be able to acquire more than one language over the limits given in the }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook}{\fs24 . For instance, a specialist with an Intelligence of 9 should not be able to learn more than three languages. 
\par {\pntext\pard\plain\f3 \loch\af3\dbch\af0\hich\f3 \'b7\tab}}\pard \fi-360\li600\nowidctlpar\tx-1440\tx-720\tx240\tx270\tx720\tx2136\tx3417{\*\pn \pnlvlblt\ilvl0\ls1\pnrnot0\pnf3\pnindent360 {\pntxtb \'b7}}\ls1\adjustright {\fs24 
The DM should consider limiting extra languages to high-level specialists; level 15
 or higher is suggested, but the DM has the final decision. (In other words, our specialist with an Intelligence of 9 cannot learn his third language until he reaches level 15.) }{\i\fs24 
\par {\pntext\pard\plain\f3 \loch\af3\dbch\af0\hich\f3 \'b7\tab}}\pard \fi-360\li600\nowidctlpar\tx-1440\tx-720\tx240\tx270\tx720\tx2136\tx3417{\*\pn \pnlvlblt\ilvl0\ls1\pnrnot0\pnf3\pnindent360 {\pntxtb \'b7}}\ls1\adjustright {\fs24 
Learning the extra language should never be automatic. The DM should oblige t
he specialist to locate a suitable tutor, devote several hours a day to studying difficult texts, or invent some other requirement that emphasizes role-playing. For the transfigurist, nothing about his specialty suggests an exceptional aptitude for langua
ges, so he'll be restricted to the language limits given in the }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook.

\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Oppositional Schools
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab \tab Each school lies in opposition to one to three of the existing schools of magic. The specialist of the new school will be unable to learn spells from the schools that lie in opposition to his school. \tab 
\par \tab \tab The first step in determining oppositional schools is to decide which existing school most closely resembles the new school. In some cases, this is obvious; for instance, our new school of metamorphic
s is most like the school of alteration. For less obvious cases, you can eliminate most of the possibilities by recalling which type of magic your new school is derived from (see the Types of Magic section above). A new school will most closely resemble a
n
 existing school derived from the same type of magic (see Table 4); for instance, if your new school produces Creation effects, it most closely resembles either the school of illusion or invocation/evocation. Once the choices have been narrowed to two or 
three schools, it should be easy to pick the school most like your new school. If necessary, try comparing your new spells to the existing spells in the}{\i\fs24  Player's Handbook}{\fs24  . 
\par 
\par \tab \tab When you've decided which existing school most closely resembles your new school
, consult the opposition diagram (Diagram 1). The school that lies directly opposite this school is the oppositional school. The school of metamorphics most closely resembles the school of alteration. The school directly across from alteration on Diagram 
1 is abjuration. Therefore, abjuration is the school that is in opposition to metamorphics. 
\par \tab \tab One to three oppositional schools may be assigned to a new school. If the new school is relatively weak (the weak school of greater divination has only a single o
ppositional school), only one opposition school may be needed. If your new school is relatively powerful, it is appropriate to assign it as many as three oppositional schools. 
\par \tab \tab Look again at Diagram 1. The schools on either side of the oppositional schoo
l are also options for oppositional schools. For instance, additional oppositional schools for illusion are invocation/evocation and abjuration.  If it's appropriate for your school to have three oppositional schools, choose these three. 
\par \tab \tab Most likely, yo
ur new school will be neither extremely weak nor extremely powerful. In this case, consider giving it two oppositional schools. One should be the initial oppositional school, and the other can be either of the adjacent schools. To decide between the adjac
ent schools, choose randomly or choose the one that seems less compatible with your new school. 
\par \tab \tab We must choose the oppositional schools for our new school of metamorphics. Since it is neither exceptionally weak or powerful, we will assign it two oppositional schools. 
\par \tab \tab We decided previously that the school of metamorphics most closely resembles the school of alteration. According to Diagram 1, the oppositional school of alteration is abjuration; therefore, the oppositional school of metamorphics is also 
abjuration. 
\par \tab \tab According to Diagram 1, the adjacent oppositional schools for abjuration-- and likewise, for metamorphics-- are conjuration/summoning and necromancy. We need to choose one of them for our other oppositional school. Either conjuration/summoni
ng or necromancy would be appropriate, but since the school of alteration already has abjuration and necromancy for its oppositional schools, we will choose the other combination. Therefore, the opposition schools for metamorphics are abjuration and conju
ration/summoning. 
\par \tab \tab Admittedly, the choice of the second and third oppositional schools is somewhat arbitrary, but remember that we not only strive for balance, but also for schools with unique advantages and restrictions. The DM always has the option to i
nvent a rationale for the existence of specific oppositional schools. For instance, the energies employed by conjuration/summoning and abjuration magic might induce agonizing headaches in a transfigurist, making it impossible for him to learn spells from 
those schools
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Ethos
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab \tab The final step in designing a new school is creating a unique ethos. This step is optional, but it adds color to the school and makes it more interesting for the players. 
\par \tab \tab An ethos also serves as a springboard for determining the p
ersonality of specialist characters. An ethos can be anything from a simple outline to a detailed profile. Following are some questions to consider when designing an ethos for a new school. 
\par \tab \tab }{\i\fs24 Do the specialists of the school adhere to any particular philosophy?}{\fs24  }{\i\fs24 Do they share any particular goals?}{\fs24 
 Such philosophies and goals are often derived from the nature of the magic studied by the specialist. For instance, specialists from the school of metamorphics study spells dealing with change. Continual exposure 
to the transience of all things might lead transfigurists to be skeptical about the existence of absolutes--a transfigurist, then, might believe that concepts such as "right" and "wrong" are relative to specific situations. 
\par \tab \tab }{\i\fs24 Are evil-aligned characters more drawn to this school than good-aligned characters (or vice versa)?}{\fs24 
 In most cases, wizards of all alignments can be specialists in any school, but a new school might discourage certain alignments and encourage others. Likewise, certain magical academies might accept students of specific alignments only. 
\par \tab \tab If a school does not promote harm to any living creature, or promotes healing, safety, comfort, or compassion, then it probably excludes evil alignments. If it promotes cruelty or self-interest, the sc
hool probably excludes good alignments. If a school promotes no particular philosophy, it probably includes specialists of all alignments. 
\par \tab \tab If a school advocates logical thinking and adherence to strict behavioral norms, and discourages excessive self-ex
pression, it probably leans toward lawful alignments. If it encourages creative thinking, freedom of expression, and spontaneous actions, it leans toward chaotic alignments (this is particularly true if it also encourages defiance of written laws to achie
v
e individual goals). If the school takes no particular position on the specialist's relationship with his culture and society, it probably includes lawful, neutral, and chaotic specialists. (The school of metamorphics takes no particular positions on thes
e issues, therefore it is open to specialists of all alignments. Note that this attitude about alignments is also consistent with the school's general philosophy of skepticism about absolutes described above.) 
\par \tab \tab }{\i\fs24 Are any particular personality types drawn t
o the study of this school? Do they tend to share any common eccentricities? Common likes or dislikes? Would anything about your new school tend to discourage certain types of people or attract others?}{\fs24 
 The school of metamorphics attracts students with a na
tural interest in the world around them. Since its spells change one thing into another, most students will be interested in how things work and how things are put together-- in short, metamorphics students are analytical, curious, and creative. 
\par \tab \tab }{\i\fs24 What's the relationship of the specialist to other members of his party?}{\fs24 
 Usually, the type of spells available to a specialist will suggest his role in the campaign. If the specialist has a lot of offensive spells, he will likely be on the front lines when the pa
rty goes to battle. A specialist with a lot of defensive or reconnaissance spells might be a good spy or investigator. Although we haven't yet devised many spells for our transfigurists, it looks like neither offensive nor defensive spells will predominat
e. Therefore, it seems likely that a transfigurist will leave the bulk of the fighting to others in his party. 
\par \tab \tab }{\i\fs24 Do specialists of this school tend to have a lot of friends? Are they likely to have spouses and families?}{\fs24  This depends on the specialist's phi
losophy, goals, and personality. Unless the specialist is extreme in one of these areas-- for instance, if he is obsessive about the study of magic, or if his field is considered repulsive or frightening (such as the school of necromancy)-- he is likely t
o have an average number of friends and an average chance at a successful marriage. (Since transfigurists have no extreme traits, we will assume that they have a fair number of friends and are as likely as anyone to marry and raise a family.) 
\par \tab \tab }{\i\fs24 Where do these specialists prefer to live?}{\fs24 
 As mentioned previously, certain schools tend to attract certain types of people. If a school's specialists tend to be outgoing and affable, they probably prefer to live in an urban area. If they're brooding and anti-social
, or if they're conducting potentially dangerous research, they probably live in an isolated area. Usually, a specific location won't suggest itself-- specialists tend to live just about anywhere. We will make this the case with transfigurists. \tab 

\par \tab \tab }{\i\fs24 How do the specialists spend most of their time?}{\fs24 
 Reclusive types will stay close to home, usually lost in research, reading, or writing. Curious types are more inclined to explore the world, eager to meet people and experience new situations. In most cases, there
 will not be obvious pastimes applicable to all specialists of a school. This will be the case with transfigurists. They spend some of their time doing research at home and a fair amount of time out in the world exploring and socializing. 
\par \tab \tab }{\i\fs24 How do the specialists typically earn a living?}{\fs24 
 Common occupations for wizards include teaching, counseling, researching, and advising. However, the spells available to a particular specialist might suggest additional careers. The metamorphics spells do not suggest any 
particular occupation, so transfigurists probably pursue the common wizard occupations. 
\par 
\par }{\b\fs32\cf2 Chapter 3: Wizard Kits}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab \tab In Chapter 1, we discussed at length the schools of magic described in the }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook}{\fs24 . In Chapter 2, we explained how to design new s
chools. Specialization in a school is an excellent way to individualize a wizard character, but it is not the only way. 
\par \tab \tab In this chapter, we'll show you how to further individualize a wizard character by choosing a wizard kit. A kit is a collection of sk
ills, proficiencies, advantages, and disadvantages used to help define a wizard's personality and background as well as his role in the campaign
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Kits and Character Creation}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab \tab Wizard kits are entirely optional-- a wizard character can easily get along wit
hout one. But a player who wishes to add detail to his wizard should choose a kit when the character is first created. Only one wizard kit can be chosen for a character. 
\par \tab  It is possible to incorporate these rules into existing campaigns, providing the pl
ayers and the DM can agree on which kits are appropriate. A kit must be compatible with a character's past actions, his background, and his established personality traits. For instance, if a diviner has been played as a thoughtful man of reason with a his
tory of preferring negotiation to combat, and the player has made it clear that his character is from a sophisticated urban culture, it doesn't make sense to assign him the Savage Wizard kit. 
\par \tab \tab Once a particular kit has been assigned to a character, it can
not be changed. However, the character can later abandon it if he wishes, giving up all benefits and hindrances. Bonus proficiencies (see below) are not forfeited. Instead, such proficiencies are no longer considered to be bonuses. The former bonus profic
iencies are set aside until the character acquires new proficiency slots; at that time, the new proficiency slots are filled by the former bonus proficiencies. 
\par \tab \tab When designing a new character, first determine the character's ability scores, race, specialization, and alignment. 
\par \tab \tab Once these elements have been decided, choose a kit for the new character. After choosing the kit and recording the information on the character sheet, continue with the character's proficiencies, money and equipment, and other pe
rtinent information. 
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Kits and Schools of Magic}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab \tab Kits are culturally-based. Generally, any kit can be assigned to a specialist from any school. An Amazon-- one of several kits described below-- might be a necromancer or an illusionist, while a Mystic-- 
another type of kit-- could be a diviner or an abjurer. 
\par \tab \tab However, there are occasional exceptions. Diviners, for instance, require a high Wisdom score, but the Savage Wizard-- a kit associated with the more primitive parts of the world-- usually lacks th
e necessary intuition and insight to specialize in the school of greater divination. Likewise, there are also some schools that favor certain kits. 
\par \tab \tab All excluded schools and preferred schools are noted in each kit description. But these are only suggestions-- a Savage Wizard diviner is perfectly acceptable if the DM rules that such a character is allowable in his campaign. 
\par \tab \tab Unless the DM determines otherwise, all kits are available to mages
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 DM\'99 Choices 
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab \tab Before allowing players to choose kits for their characters, the DM should look at each kit and consider several factors. 
\par \tab \tab }{\i\fs24 Is this kit appropriate to the campaign?}{\fs24  Not all kits make sense for every campaign. If it is established that Amaz
ons do not exist in the DM's campaign world, he should not allow players to choose the Amazon kit. The DM should tell the players which kits he will allow and which are forbidden before they create their characters. 
\par \tab \tab }{\i\fs24 Do the players need more information about a kit?}{\fs24 
 The DM might want to furnish the players with additional background information about a particular kit. For instance, he might tell them that in his world, the Savage Wizards all live on the jungle peninsula of Blackroot and have had little-- 
if any-- contact with other civilizations. 
\par \tab \tab }{\i\fs24 Are there any changes in the kit? }{\fs24 The DM is free to make changes in the proficiencies, hindrances, and any other components of the kits to make them compatible with his campaign world. The players should be inf
ormed of any such changes before they choose kits for their characters.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 The Wizard Kits
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab \tab Each wizard kit consists of a variety of elements. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Description:}{\fs24  This section explains the cultural background, appearance, and manner of characters associated wi
th this kit. It also lists any requirements necessary for characters taking the kit; for instance, characters taking the Amazon Sorceress kit must be female. Suggestions are also given for how a character might abandon the kit. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Preferred Schools:}{\fs24  This lists which specialists are most appropriate to the kit. As explained in the }{\i\fs24 Kits and Schools of Magic}{\fs24 
 section above, there are many exceptions, and these should be considered suggestions only. 
\par \tab \tab Chapter 1 outlined an ethos for each school, suggesting phil
osophies, attitudes, and personality traits for each specialist. When designing a character, the player should compare the personality traits and attitudes of the character's school with those of his kit. If a conflict arises, the player can choose whiche
v
er traits and attitudes he prefers, or whichever seem to make the most sense for his character. For instance, according to the abjurer's ethos in Chapter 1, an abjurer tends to be gentle and soft-spoken. However, a player who chooses the Amazon Sorceress 
kit may decide that his Amazon Sorceress abjurer is out-going and boisterous, as is appropriate to the Amazonian culture of his campaign world. With the DM's permission, an out-going, boisterous Amazon Sorceress abjurer is perfectly acceptable. 
\par \tab \tab In genera
l, a character's cultural background will have more influence on his personality than his school. Therefore, if a player cannot decide between the personality traits associated with his school's ethos and the traits associated with his character's kit, he
 should give more emphasis to the kit traits. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Barred Schools:}{\fs24  This entry explains which schools are inappropriate for the kit. Though the DM is free to make exceptions, it is usually not a good idea to assign a kit to a specialist from a barred school. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Role:}{\fs24  This section describes the role of a particular wizard in his society and in his campaign. For instance, an Amazon Sorceress has a different cultural role than a Witch, even if both are enchanters. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Secondary Skills:}{\fs24  If you're using the Secondary Skills rules from the AD&D\'ae
 2nd Edition game rules, then a kit may require a character to take a specific skill instead of choosing or rolling randomly for it. (When choosing kits for characters, we suggest you use the Weapon and Nonweapon Proficiency rul
es instead of the Secondary Skills rules.) 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Weapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24  If you are using the Weapon Proficiency rules from the AD&D 2nd Edition game, this entry indicates which Weapon Proficiency is required for characters taking this kit. In some cases, a spe
cific Weapon Proficiency is required; in other cases, a Weapon Proficiency can be chosen from among a list of recommended proficiencies. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Nonweapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24  If you are using the Nonweapon Proficiency rules, this entry indicates whether specific Non
weapon Proficiencies are required for characters taking this kit. However, unlike Weapon Proficiencies, the Nonweapon Proficiencies are bonuses. If a kit requires that the character must have Astrology, then the character gets that proficiency free, above
 and beyond the slots he is normally granted. Even if such proficiencies belong to groups other than the Wizard or General groups, the character still gets them as bonuses at no charge. 
\par \tab \tab If the kit grants a Nonweapon Proficiency that the wizard already has because of his specialization, the character receives instead one extra free Nonweapon Proficiency slot. He may spend this free slot on any specialization of his choice. 

\par \tab \tab Some Nonweapon Proficiencies are recommended, not required. In such cases, the ch
aracter is not required to take the proficiency if he does not want it. If he takes a recommended proficiency, he spends the normal number of his available proficiency slots. 
\par \tab \tab Table 38 on page 55 of the }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook}{\fs24  lists Nonweapon Proficiency cross
overs for various groups. The crossover groups that apply to mages and illusionists also apply to specialists from all other schools; that is, any specialist selecting a Nonweapon Proficiency from the Wizard or General groups shown on Table 37 (page 54-55
 of the}{\i\fs24  PH}{\fs24 
) spends the listed number of proficiency slots. When any specialist selects a proficiency from any other category, he must spend one additional slot beyond the number listed (exceptions are given in the Nonweapon Proficiencies entries for the va
rious kits). 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Equipment:}{\fs24 
 Some wizard types tend to use specific equipment. Others have limitations or restrictions on the way they acquire or use equipment. This entry details the equipment employed by characters using this kit. (In no case is a wizard a
llowed to purchase armor.) 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Special Benefits:}{\fs24  Most kits grant special benefits to characters. Often, these benefits are defined as special reaction bonuses when encountering certain classes of society, or as special rights in specific cultures. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Special Hindrances:}{\fs24  Each kit carries certain disadvantages to hinder the wizard. Often, these are reaction penalties or cultural restrictions. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Wealth Options:}{\fs24  Some wizard types have special rules regarding their wealth. Usually, these rules specify differences in the amount of money received when the character is created and limitations on how the money can be spent. 

\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Races:}{\fs24  If a kit is not available to particular races, this will be noted here. Unless the DM makes exceptions for his campaign, humans can choose any of the kits.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 A Note About Reaction Adjustments 
\par 
\par }{\fs24 \tab \tab Several of the wizard kits receive reaction bonuses and penalties as part of their special benefits and special hindrances. As noted in the }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook}{\fs24  (page 18), characters with very high o
r very low Charisma receive "reaction adjustments. " A character with high Charisma gets a bonus (expressed as a plus, such as +3), while a character with low Charisma gets a penalty (expressed as a minus, such as -3). 
\par \tab \tab When rolling 2d10 for encounter reactions (see page 103 in the }{\i\fs24 Dungeon Master's Guide}{\fs24 
), do not add the bonus or subtract the penalty from the die roll. If the character has a Charisma of 16, thus receiving a +5 reaction adjustment, subtract that number from the die roll-- do not add it. Ot
herwise, the more Charisma a character has, the worse the reaction of the NPCs
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 The Kits}{\fs24  
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Academician}{\fs24 
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24 \tab \tab Description:}{\fs24  The Academician is a learned scholar whose love of knowledge is matched only by his preoccupation with research. He is fascinated by magi
c in all its forms and enjoys nothing more than poring over arcane texts and experimenting with exotic magical devices.
\par \tab  The Academician spends so much time involved in intellectual pursuits that he tends to neglect his physical skills. He is not a partic
ularly good fighter and avoids combat when he can, preferring negotiation and parley to violence. Still, he recognizes the necessity of combat in certain instances, and will fight valiantly when required. 
\par \tab \tab Academicians can be found in virtually any culture, but they are most likely to come from large urban areas that provide ready access to libraries, museums, laboratories, and other resources. 
\par \tab \tab A character must have a minimum Intelligence of 13 and a minimum Wisdom of 11 to become an Academician. 
\par \tab \tab Th
ere are no special rules for abandoning this kit. An Academician who becomes disillusioned with the academic life or loses interest in intellectual pursuits can choose to neglect his studies or research, but he is free to resume them at any time. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Preferred Schools:}{\fs24  The Academician is intrigued by all the schools of magic, but is especially drawn to schools with a wide range of spells, including alteration, illusion, and invocation/evocation. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Barred Schools:}{\fs24  There are no barred schools for the Academician.

 In his homeland, the Academician is a respected member of society, valued for his skills as a teacher and advisor as well as for his seemingly endless store of knowledge on a variety of subjects. Most likely, he will fill similar roles in a campaign. 

\par \tab \tab In spite of his somewhat sedentary background, the Academician welcomes the chance to join an adventuring party. For him, it is an unparalleled opportunity to experience new cultures, acquire new devices, and acquire first-hand information abou
t people, places, and creatures he may have only read about. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Secondary Skills:}{\fs24  Required: Scribe. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Weapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24  Required (the player may choose from the following): Dagger, Dart, Knife, or Sling. 
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Nonweapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24  Bonus Proficiency: 
Reading/Writing. Recommended: (General) Artistic Ability, Etiquette, Heraldry, Languages (Modern); (Wizard) Ancient History, Astrology, Herbalism, Languages (Ancient), Spellcraft; (Priest) Local History.
\par \tab \tab }{\b\fs24 Special Benefits:}{\fs24  The Academician receives both of the following benefits:
\par \tab \tab 1. Academicians maintain an extensive correspondence with scholars throughout the world. Additionally, an Academician's reputation as a man of wisdom often precedes him. When encountering an NPC who is familiar with his reputatio
n, who turns out to be one of his correspondents, who fancies himself an intellectual, or who is an author, researcher, teacher, journalist, or fellow scholar, the Academician receives a +3 reaction bonus. 
\par \tab \tab 2. The Academician receives a bonus to all Inte
lligence Checks and Wisdom Checks. The DM has two options for assigning this bonus. He may simply give the Academician a flat +1 to his Intelligence and Wisdom Checks, or he can consult Table 5, which takes the Academician's age and race into account; as 
the Academician ages, his bonuses increase. Once a method for assigning these bonuses is chosen, it cannot be changed later. 
\par \tab 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Special Hindrances:}{\fs24  Academicians lack the training and instinct to make good hand-to-hand fighters. When attacking with any type
 of melee weapon, the Academician always has a -1 penalty to hit on his first blow. Subsequent blows-- when the Academician has had an opportunity to size up his opponent and adjust his attacks accordingly-- are made without this penalty. However, if the 
Academician attacks a different opponent, his first blow against his new victim is also made at -1. 
\par \tab \tab Academicians tend to be know-it-alls, and unhesitatingly offer their opinions even on matters they know little about. Whenever the party needs to make a d
ecision, the Academician should offer his opinion; for effective role-playing, the player should have his player speak his mind with unshakable confidence. If other player characters disagree, the Academician might lecture them on the error of their ways,
 welcome the opportunity for a spirited argument, or roll his eyes at his companion's blatant display of ignorance.

\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Amazon Sorceress
\par }{\fs24 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Description:}{\fs24  Amazons belong to matriarchal societies that thrive in a world otherwise dominated by males. Women occupy all important positions in Amazon societies-- they are the rulers, artisans, soldiers, and scholars. 
\par      Most Amazon societies have existed unchanged for thousands of years, living in relative isolation from the rest of the word, but others have more recent origins. Some w
ere established by disgruntled women who tired of their subservient roles in male-dominated cultures and decided to rule themselves, while others were created by deities sympathetic to the plight of women. 
\par      Men are second-class citizens in Amazon cult
ures, occupying positions of menial servitude to their female superiors. In some societies, men are kept as slaves, treated only marginally better than domestic animals. Still others have eliminated men entirely. 
\par      Amazons from totally male-free societ
ies make occasional forays into neighboring communities to fraternize with men. Others perpetuate their civilization by being extremely friendly with male adventurers passing through their territory; when the Amazons tire of their company, the adventurers
 are sent on their way or killed. 
\par      An Amazon society may be as small as a single village or large enough to fill an entire continent. Because they are continually under siege from male-dominated civilizations, Amazons have mastered the art of war. Trad
itionally, Amazons are superior horse breeders and riders, excelling with spears, bows, and other weapons that can be wielded from horseback. 
\par      A character must be female to be an Amazon. There are no other requirements. 
\par      To abandon this kit, the character must renounce her Amazon citizenship, most likely because she has grown to identify more closely with a different culture. 
\par     }{\b\fs24  Preferred Schools:}{\fs24  Amazons with high Constitution tend to be drawn to the schools of conjuration/summoning and invoca
tion/evocation; both are especially useful on the battlefield. Diviners are also common, as they make excellent administrative advisors and counselors. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Barred Schools:}{\fs24  Amazons shun the dark forces associated with the school of necromancy. Because of its perceived uselessness in combat, they also avoid the school of illusion. 
\par }\pard \nowidctlpar\tx-720\tx270\tx720\tx1495\tx2883\tx4378\tx5767\tx7262{\*\pn \pnlvlcont\ilvl0\ls0\pnrnot0\pndec }\adjustright {\fs24     }{\b\fs24  Role:}{\fs24 
 Most Amazons are warriors, but the few wizards among them are held in high regard, as is any person who has mastered a difficult art. Amazon Sorceresses typically serv
e as seers, advisors, counselors, and administrators. Because of their formidable power, Amazon Sorceresses especially invokers and conjurers-- are always welcome on the battlefield. 
\par      In male-dominated cultures, the Amazon is regarded as a curiosity a
t best. She is stared at, whispered about, and sometimes openly ridiculed. Well-meaning women who have accepted subservience as a cultural norm may try to convince the Amazon to change her unnatural ways, while chauvinistic men, seeing her as a threat to 
their masculinity, may feel compelled to dominate her in any number of ways. Even open-minded citizens will likely be suspicious of a female with such unusual attitudes. 
\par      Among her peers in an adventuring party, the Amazon Sorceress will prove to be a 
courageous fighter and a capable spell caster. Although the other player-characters may harbor some prejudices of their own about the role of females, the DM should discourage any overt discrimination; once she has proven herself in tough situations, the 
Amazon should be accepted as an equal in all regards.

aracter is first created, she must buy her weapons from among the following choices only: bow (any type), dagger/dirk, javelin, knife, spear. Once she has adventured elsewhere in the world, she may purchase other types of weapons. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Special Benefits:}{\fs24  M
ale opponents who have never encountered the formidable Amazon women tend to underestimate them. Therefore, the first time such a male encounters an Amazon in combat, the Amazon receives a +3 bonus to hit and +3 to damage on her first blow only. These bon

\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Anagakok}{\fs24 
\par 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Description:}{\fs24  The Anagakok is a wizard from a primitive society that occupies one of the world's most
 extreme climates. Primarily concerned with survival, the Anagakok uses his magical skills to help his fellow tribesmen locate food, plan for dangerous shifts in the weather, and protect them from hostile creatures and rival tribes who are in competition 
for the same limited resources. An Anagakok also brings good fortune to his tribe; many believe he is possessed by a guardian spirit (though there is no actual evidence of this). 
\par      The Anagakok is known by a variety of names which depend on his society of origin; other names for an Anagakok include Magian, Phylacterist, Veronican, Scarabor, and Obeahist. 
\par      Although an Anagakok can originate from any number of hostile environments, two are considered in this discussion. The first is the Anagakok from 
a climate where the temperature never rises above 0 degrees F., whom we call the Frigid Climate Anagakok. The second is the Anagakok from a climate where the temperature never falls below 100 degrees F., whom we call the Torrid Climate Anagakok. 
\par      To be an Anagakok, a wizard must have a Constitution of at least 13. Female Anagakok are as common as males. 
\par      Though an Anagakok can renounce his heritage and sever ties with his society, he cannot renounce this kit; the traits of an Anagakok are inborn and permanent. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Preferred Schools:}{\fs24  The preferred schools of the Anagakok are abjuration, alteration, enchantment/charm, invocation/evocation, and greater divination. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Barred Schools:}{\fs24  Anagakok are barred from the schools of illusion and necromancy because of their spells' relative uselessness for surviving in hostile environments. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Role:}{\fs24  The Anagakok is serious-minded, even-tempered, and soft-spoken. Though unfamiliar with societies and cultures other than his own, he adapts quickly and is fascinated by technology in all its forms. 
\par      In a campaign, an Anagakok tends to assume responsibility for the safety of his companions; their security is always foremost in his mind. Though the Anagakok are not natural leaders (such roles are usually rese
rved for the strongest warriors in their tribes) they are superb and fearless combatants, quick to volunteer for the most dangerous missions. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Secondary Skills:}{\fs24  Required (choose one of the following, based on the Anagakok's background): Fisher, Forester, Hunter, Navigator, Trapper/Furrier. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Weapon Proficiency:}{\fs24  Required (choose one of the following, based on the Anagakok's background): Bow (any), dagger, harpoon, javelin, knife, sling, trident. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Nonweapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24  Bonus: Endurance, Survi
val, Weather Sense. Recommended: (General) Direction Sense, Fire-building, Riding (Land-based), Rope Use, Swimming; (Wizard) Astrology; (Warrior, all cost single slots) Animal Lore, Hunting, Mountaineering, Running, Set Snares. 
\par     }{\b\fs24  Equipment:}{\fs24  A beginning
 Anagakok can buy weapons only from those listed in the Weapon Proficiency entry above. He can buy only equipment that would normally be available in his home society; the DM has the right to veto any initial purchase.
\par      An Anagakok must spend all his initial money. Any money not spent is lost. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Special Benefits:}{\fs24  An Anagakok can find food in even the most barren of environments. In a 24-hour period, an Anagakok can find enough food to feed himself and a number of people equal to his level (for insta
nce, a 4th-level Anagakok can find enough food to feed himself and four others every day). 
\par      Once per week, an Anagakok can cast a special}{\i\fs24  good fortune}{\fs24  spell on himself and a number of people equal to his level; the effect of }{\i\fs24 good fortune}{\fs24  lasts for a n
umber of turns equal to his level (for instance, a 4th-level Anagakok can cast }{\i\fs24 good fortune}{\fs24 
 on himself and four others, and the effect lasts for four turns). All opponents have a -1 penalty on their chance to hit when attacking those under the effect of }{\i\fs24 good fortune}{\fs24 
. This ability is innate; an Anagakok is not required to memorize }{\i\fs24 good fortune}{\fs24 
, nor does it count against his daily spell limit.  To cast the spell, an Anagakok must merely concentrate for 1 round and point to the subjects to be affected; no verbal or material components are required. 
\par      Additionally, an Anagakok has natural immunities to environmental extremes based on his background. A Frigid Climate Anagakok suffers no penalties, damage, or other restrictions in environments of extreme cold.
 A Torrid Climate Anagakok suffers no penalties, damage, or other restrictions in environments of extreme heat. These immunities apply to natural conditions only; for instance, a Frigid Climate Anagakok suffers normal damage from }{\i\fs24 cone of cold}{
\fs24  and other cold-based spells, while a Torrid Climate Anagakok suffers normal damage from}{\i\fs24  fireball}{\fs24  and other heat-based spells. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Special Hindrances:}{\fs24  Exposure to harsh climates gives the Anagakok an unusual appearance, such as a tough, leathery skin for the Torrid Cl
imate Anagakok, and a head-to-toe covering of short, coarse hair for the Frigid Climate Anagakok. Because of his appearance and strange manner, an Anagakok suffers a -2 reaction penalty from all NPCs unfamiliar with the Anagakok's culture. 
\par      Just as th
eir backgrounds provide them with natural immunities to certain environmental extremes, all Anagakok suffer penalties when exposed to environments radically different from those in which they were born. A Frigid Climate Anagakok suffers a -1 penalty to al
l
 attack rolls, damage rolls, Ability Checks, and saving throws in environments with temperatures above 100 degrees F. A Torrid Climate Anagakok suffers a -1 penalty to all attack rolls, damage rolls, Ability Checks, and saving throws in environments with 
temperatures below 0 degrees F. 
\par     }{\b\fs24  Wealth Options:}{\fs24  A beginning Anagakok receives only (1d4 +1) x 8 gp as starting money. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Races:}{\fs24  No restrictions. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Notes: }{\fs24 Players and DMs are encouraged to invent their own types of Anagakok from other extreme en
vironments. An Anagakok who lives in the bottom of an active volcano, in the depths of the ocean, or on an island continually battered by hurricane winds are all possibilities. Use the examples above to develop appropriate bonuses and penalties for each t
ype of Anagakok based on his background.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Militant Wizard
\par }{\fs24 
\par }{\b\fs24      Description}{\fs24 : The Militant Wizard is skilled in both magical and military arts, making him an extremely formidable opponent. They can come from aggressive, warmongering cultures bent on the conq
uest of weaker nations, or from cultures continually under siege from their more warlike neighbors, making military preparedness vital to their defense. In any case, the Militant Wizard considers a trained body as important as a trained mind, and prides h
imself on keeping his combat skills as sharp as his magical talents. 
\par      A character must have a Strength of at least 13 to be a Militant Wizard. Though male Militant Wizards will be more common, female Militant Wizards are allowable as well, unless the DM's world specifically forbids them. 
\par      Abandoning this kit is difficult. A Militant Wizard must abstain from using both of the weapons he has chosen for his Weapon Proficiencies for three full experience levels. Once he reaches the third experience lev
el, he loses the use of his two Weapon Proficiencies. If he then renounces his citizenship from his home culture, he can successfully abandon this kit. 
\par      For example, consider a 5th-level Militant Wizard with Weapon Proficiencies in short sword and lon
g bow. If he abstains from using both of these weapons (and the corresponding Weapon Proficiencies), he loses his Weapon Proficiencies in short sword and long bow when he reaches 8th level. If he then renounces his citizenship from his home culture, he ca
n
 abandon this kit. If he uses these weapons before reaching 8th level, he must begin again, abstaining for an additional three levels of experience (for instance, if he uses his long bow Weapon Proficiency when at 7th level, he'll have to abstain until he
 reaches 10th level in order to abandon this kit.) 
\par     }{\b\fs24  Preferred Schools:}{\fs24  Militant Wizards prefer schools with an excess of offensive and defensive spells, such as abjuration, alteration, conjuration/summoning, invocation/evocation, and necromancy. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Barred Schools:}{\fs24 
 Militant Wizards are barred from specializing in the schools of enchantment/charm and illusion, as their cultures tend to consider them relatively useless in combat. Though greater divination has uses on the battlefield, particularly in th
e area of reconnaissance, Militant Wizards are discouraged, but not barred, from divination specialization. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Role:}{\fs24  Militant Wizards are among the most honored and respected citizens in their societies, since their powerful magic makes them exceptional
ly able soldiers. Depending on his background, the Militant Wizard may be a brutal, savage killer, wallowing in the violence of the battlefield, or he may be a heroic warrior, fighting with honor and taking lives only when necessary. 
\par      A Militant Wizar
d might have a variety of reasons for joining an adventuring party. Perhaps he shares the party's goal of defeating a force of evil, or he might be seeking treasure to finance his own army at home. He might wish to study the fighting techniques of other c
ultures, or he might hire on as a mercenary. 
\par      Whatever his reasons, the Militant Wizard's fighting skills should greatly benefit any party. He makes an excellent leader, but he is also capable of following orders to the letter, assuming the orders are 
issued by a commander he respects. The Militant Wizard tends to prefer action to inaction and combat to negotiation. He is skeptical of scholarly and philosophic types, and is unlikely to form close relationships with such characters. 
\par     }{\b\fs24  Secondary Skills:}{\fs24  No particular Secondary Skill is recommended or required. He receives his Secondary Skill either by choosing or rolling randomly, whatever method is normal for the campaign. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Weapon Proficiency:}{\fs24  Required (choose one from of the following): Battle a
xe, bow (any), crossbow (any), dagger, javelin, sling, spear, sword (any), warhammer. These are different from the weapons normally associated with wizards, but they are common for Militant Wizards. Also, see the Special Benefits section below. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Nonweapon Proficiency:}{\fs24 
 Bonus: (Warrior) Endurance. Recommended: (General) Animal Handling, Direction Sense, Riding (Land-based), Swimming;(Wizard) Languages (Ancient); (Warrior; these take 2 slots only) Blind- fighting, Tracking, (Warrior; these take 1 slot onl
y) Mountaineering, Running, Set Snares. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Equipment:}{\fs24  The Militant Wizard may buy any equipment he chooses, keeping whatever money he might not use. 
\par     }{\b\fs24  Special Benefits:}{\fs24  The Militant Wizard receives a bonus Weapon Proficiency free of charge; this is 
in addition to his normal Weapon Proficiency. This bonus Weapon Proficiency does not use any of the wizard's proficiency slots, but he must choose it from the weapons listed in the Weapon Proficiency entry above. Additionally, a Militant Wizard can acquir
e any of the Warrior's Nonweapon Proficiencies given on Table 37 on page 55 of the }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook}{\fs24 
 at the listed number of slots; for instance, if a Militant Wizard wants the Animal Lore proficiency, it costs him only 1 slot instead of the normal 2 for a wizard. 
\par     }{\b\fs24  Special Hindrances:}{\fs24 
 Because a Militant Wizard devotes so much of his time and energy to the mastery of military skills, he is limited in his access to spells from various schools. Table 6 lists the oppositional schools for Militant Wizards of
 each specialty; the Militant Wizard is forbidden to learn spells from these schools.

\par \tab Militant Wizard mages are likewise limited. The DM may decide which of the following limitations affects Militant Wizard mages in his campaign (choose only one limitation). 
\par 
\par      1. The Militant Wizard mage is forbidden to learn 8th-level and 9th-level spells from any school. 
\par      2. The Militant Wizard mage learns spells as if his Intelligence were two points lower than he actually has, as indicated on Table 4, page 16 of the }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook}{\fs24 
. This limitation also affects the number of languages he can learn, the highest 
level of spells he can cast, the maximum number of spells per level he can know, and his spell immunity. For instance, if this limitation is in effect for a Militant Wizard mage with an Intelligence score of 15, he can only know three languages, can cast 
spells of no higher than 6th-level, has a 55 percent chance to learn a new spell, and has a maximum of nine spells per level that he can know. 
\par      3. The Militant Wizard mage can learn spells from only five schools. To determine which schools are unavaila
ble to him, roll 1d8 three times, where 1 = abjuration, 2 = conjuration/summoning, 3 = greater divination, 4 = enchantment/charm, 5 = illusion, 6 = invocation/evocation, 7 = necromancy, and 8 = alteration. If the same result occurs twice, roll again. 

\par      }{\b\fs24 Wealth Options:}{\fs24  The Militant Wizard receives the standard (1d4 + 1) x 10 starting money. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Races:}{\fs24  No restrictions
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Mystic}{\fs24 
\par 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Description:}{\fs24  Thoughtful, reserved, and extremely introspective, the Mystic is devoted to self-enlightenment and sees the st
udy of magic as the key to spiritual awareness. The Mystic enjoys nothing more than spending long hours contemplating the mysteries of the universe and attempting to become more in touch with his inner self. The Mystic is not necessarily a student of reli
gion or philosophy; he seeks an awareness that can only be found intuitively. 
\par      The Mystic is by no means a reluctant magic-user. In fact, the Mystic believes that the casting of each spell and the acquisition of each new magical technique brings him cl
oser to perfect awareness. The mental discipline necessary for the mastery of magic is the perfect compliment to self-knowledge. 
\par      The Mystic can come from any culture, but he is usually from a society that places a high value on philosophy, art, and s
cholarship. His is most likely to join an adventuring party for the opportunity to broaden his outlook, discover new things about himself, and use magic in new, enlightening ways. 
\par      To be a Mystic, a wizard must have a Wisdom score of at least 13. 
\par      There are no special rules for abandonment of this kit. If the Mystic grows weary of the contemplative life or feels that he has reached a pinnacle of self- awareness, he can simply leave this kit behind. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Preferred Schools:}{\fs24  The Mystic prefers the schools of illusion, divination, and enchantment/charm. 
\par     }{\b\fs24  Barred Schools:}{\fs24  Because the Mystic is predisposed against magic that harms other living things, he is barred from specializing in the schools of necromancy, invocation/evocation, and conjuration/
summoning. He is not prevented from learning spells from these schools-- he simply prefers to limit his association with them. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Role:}{\fs24  In many societies, the Mystic is considered to be little more than a crackpot, an eccentric with an utter lack of amb
ition who serves no useful purpose. In more enlightened cultures, the Mystic is seen as a seeker of truth, a sensitive soul engaged in an inspiring spiritual journey. 
\par \tab  In a campaign, the Mystic is quiet and non-aggressive. His very presence is soothing t
o the party, and he always has a word of comfort or encouragement for his companions. The Mystic avoids combat whenever possible, but courageously rises to the occasion when his comrades are threatened. Only in the most extreme circumstances will the Myst
ic intentionally take a life; however, he will kill if necessary to preserve his own life or the life of a companion. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Secondary Skills:}{\fs24  The Mystic must take one of the following as his Secondary Skill (player's choice, based on the Mystic's background): Farmer, Forester, Groom, Mason, Scribe, Tailor/Weaver, Woodworker. 
\par     }{\b\fs24  Weapon Proficiency:}{\fs24  Required (the player chooses one of the following): Dagger, dart, or sling. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Nonweapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24  Bonus: Astrology, Religion. Recommended: (General) Ag
riculture, Artistic Ability, Carpentry, Etiquette, Languages (Modern), Leatherworking, Pottery, Seamstress/Tailor, Stonemasonry, Weaving; (Wizard) Ancient History, Herbalism, Languages (Ancient), Reading/Writing, Spellcraft. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Equipment:}{\fs24  The Mystic may
 buy only the weapon associated with his Weapon Proficiency. As his adventuring career progresses, he can buy (and use) only daggers, darts, knives, and slings. He must spend all of his starting money; any leftover gold is lost. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Special Benefits:}{\fs24  The Mystic receives one of the following special abilities from the list below. The special ability is chosen when the character is first created and can never be changed. 
\par      1. Once per week, the Mystic can }{\i\fs24 feign death}{\fs24  as per the 3rd-level wizard spell; he can use this ability only on himself. The Mystic can }{\i\fs24 feign death}{\fs24 
 for up to 24 hours, awakening at any time. To use this ability, the Mystic must merely concentrate for 1 round; no components are necessary. 
\par      2. Once per week, the Mystic can transform his consciousness into a ghostly}{\i\fs24  spirit form}{\fs24 , leaving his physical body behind. The }{\i\fs24 spirit form}{\fs24  has the appearance of a misty cloud in the shape of the caster. The }{
\i\fs24 spirit form}{\fs24  cannot attack, speak, or cast spells, but it can fly at a movement rate of 24 (Maneuverability Class B) and can pass through the smallest opening or tiniest crack. The Mystic's }{\i\fs24 spirit form}{\fs24 
 can travel an unlimited distance from his physical body as long as it remains in the same plane of existence. The spirit form is invulnerable to all attack forms, but }{\i\fs24 dispel magic}{\fs24  or a similar spell causes the }{\i\fs24 spirit form}{
\fs24  to instantly return to its body. 
\par      While in }{\i\fs24 spirit form}{\fs24 , the Mystic's physical body remains comatose. The body is subject to all regular attacks and suffers damage normally. The }{\i\fs24 spirit form}{\fs24 
 can remain away from the body for up to 24 hours, but once it returns to its body, the Mystic revives and cannot use his spirit form for another week. 
\par      To use his }{\i\fs24 spirit form}{\fs24 , the Mystic must merely concentrate for 1 round; no components are necessary. 
\par      3. Once per week, the Mystic can use a special }{\i\fs24 levitate self}{\fs24 
 ability for one hour. Once initiated, the Mystic can use this ability to levitate himself straight up in the air at a rate of 10 yards per round. He can stop, hover, descend
, and ascend at will, though horizontal movement is not empowered by this ability (however, the Mystic could push himself along a wall to move laterally). While levitating, the Mystic can carry as much weight as he can normally. Unlike the }{\i\fs24 
levitation}{\fs24  spell, the Mystic using }{\i\fs24 levitate self}{\fs24  suffers no attack roll penalties when attempting to use missile weapons. 
\par      To use this ability, the Mystic must merely concentrate for 1 round; no components are required. As soon as a levitating Mystic touches the ground, his use of this ability is over; he can use it again in another week. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Special Hindrances:}{\fs24  A Mystic must spend two consecutive hours per day meditating. These two hours must always occur at the same time of day; the player can decide which hours a
re devoted to meditation, but once decided, the time period can never change (typical meditation times are the first two hours of dawn, the first two hours after sunset, or from midnight to 2 a. m. ). If the Mystic neglects to perform his meditation, is u
n
able to perform it, or is interrupted more than once (for more than a total of 1 minute), the following day he is able to cast only the number of spells allowed to a wizard one level lower than his actual level. For instance, if a 4th-level Mystic is unab
le to meditate on Day 1, on Day 2 he will be able to cast only as many spells as a 3rd-level wizard. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Wealth Options:}{\fs24  The Mystic receives only (1d4 + 1) x 5 gp as starting money. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Races:}{\fs24  No limitations
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Patrician
\par }{\fs24 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Description:}{\fs24  The Patrician i
s a wizard of noble birth, a member of his culture's aristocracy. Born into a life of wealth and privilege, the Patrician considers himself an arbiter of good taste and a connoisseur of the finer things in life. He looks down his nose at working men and w
omen, as well as all others he considers to be inconsequential rabble. If anything, his mastery of magic makes him even more arrogant than other members of the ruling class, since he sees his talent as clear proof of his superiority over common folk. 

\par      
The Patrician may join an adventuring party out of a sense of duty to his country or to promote the common good-- in spite of their snobbery, good-aligned Patricians have strong moral codes. A Patrician might have grown weary of his pampered life and soug
ht an adventuring party to add a touch of excitement to his otherwise dreary existence. Alternately, his parents might have ordered him to join a party to teach him humility. 
\par      There are no special requirements to be a Patrician. The majority are male, but noblewomen are also included in this category (although such a character would more correctly be called a Noblewoman or Aristocrat). 
\par      To abandon this kit, the Patrician must renounce his birthright. He will forever after be ostracized by all the nobility from his homeland and may even be disowned and disinherited by his family. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Preferred Schools:}{\fs24  The Patrician can specialize in any school, but prefers those that he perceives as most powerful, such as conjuration/summoning, alteration, and invocation/evocation. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Barred Schools:}{\fs24  The Patrician will not specialize in necromancy, a school he considers disgusting and repulsive. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Role:}{\fs24  The Patrician prefers the company of nobles and other members of the upper class. Most Patricians are weal
thy and have no need to earn money, but many still serve their societies as administrators, counselors, and ambassadors. Since they have access to the the finest teachers and universities, Patricians are extremely well-educated and expert in a variety of 
areas. 
\par      Fellow player characters will rightfully perceive the Patrician to be an arrogant, condescending snob. On the positive side, the Patrician is also well-mannered and courteous, even to those he considers to be his social inferiors. Male Patricia
ns can be extremely chivalrous to members of the opposite sex, regardless of whether they like it or not. The Patrician is generally cooperative with the party, though he will balk at any suggestion that compromises his sense of dignity (for instance, he 
will never enter a filthy cavern or search the bodies of slain enemies without squawking). His first-rate education and extensive travels make him an excellent source of information. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Secondary Skills:}{\fs24  Required (the player must choose one of the following): Bowyer, Gambler, Groom, Jeweler, Limner/Painter, Scribe. 
\par     }{\b\fs24  Weapon Proficiency:}{\fs24  Required (the player must choose one of the following): dagger, knife. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Nonweapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24  Bonus: (General) Etiquette, Heraldry, Riding (Land-based). Recomm
ended: (General) Dancing, Languages (Modern), Riding (Land-based), Singing; (Wizard) Ancient History, Languages (Ancient), Reading/Writing, Religion; (Rogue, double slots) Ancient History, Appraising, Gaming, Local History, Musical Instrument; (Priest, do
uble slots) Languages (Ancient). 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Equipment:}{\fs24  A beginning Patrician must buy all of the following items: horse (must be at least a riding horse), riding saddle, bit and bridle, horseshoes and shoeing, halter, and saddle blanket. He can spend the rest of
 his money as he wishes. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Special Benefits:}{\fs24  The Patrician begins with more starting money than other wizards (see the Wealth Options entry below). Additionally, he receives a +3 reaction modifier from any noble from his own culture, and a +2 reaction 
modifier from nobles from other cultures. When traveling, a Patrician can demand shelter from any fellow noblemen from his own culture. Such shelter is offered free of charge and is made available for the Patrician and up to two persons per experience lev
el of the Patrician (for instance, a 3rd-level Patrician can demand shelter for himself and six others). 
\par     }{\b\fs24  Special Hindrances:}{\fs24  When making purchases, the Patrician accepts nothing but the best, whether it be a meal, a room for the night, a weapon, or ev
en a chest to carry his possessions. Any time he buys any item, the Patrician must pay 10 to 100 percent more than the listed price in the }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook.}{\fs24 
 The DM will decide the price paid by the Patrician, which may vary from item to item, depending on
 the quality of merchandise in a particular locale. For instance, the best meal in Village A might sell for 7 sp, while the best meal in Village B might sell for 10 sp.  In all cases, the Patrician will settle for no less than the most expensive item avai
lable; he always pays at least 10 percent more than the listed price. 
\par      If a Patrician lacks the funds to buy high-quality items, he can settle for cheaper goods, but he no longer receives his reaction bonus in that particular encounter or community; NP
Cs simply do not believe that he is a noble. For instance, if a Patrician settles for a standard 5 sp meal at an inn, all of the NPCs in the inn react to him normally, ignoring his insistence that he's a nobleman. Word will quickly spread throughout the c
o
mmunity that an amusing fellow is pretending to be a nobleman, and soon all of the NPCs in the community will react to him normally. If a Patrician settles for shabby accoutrements, such as a normal sword or average saddle, all NPCs will react to him norm
ally until he replaces them with more expensive items. 
\par      Just as the Patrician can demand shelter from other noblemen, so can they demand shelter from him. Note that this can get to be an expensive proposition if the NPC noblemen stay for any length of time. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Wealth Options:}{\fs24  The Patrician receives an extra 150 gp in addition to the standard (1d4 + 1) x 10 gp. 
\par     }{\b\fs24  Races:}{\fs24  No restrictions. However, if a particular race doesn't recognize or allow socio-economic stratifications in the DM's campaign world, that race will not have Patricians
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2  Peasant Wizard}{\fs24 
\par 
\par     }{\b\fs24  Description:}{\fs24  The Peasant Wizard is a spell caster of modest means whose exceptional skills and matchless courage have made him a champion of the masses. Though his talents have set him apart and
 made him a legend in his homeland, he will never forget his roots. An advocate of the commoner, the Peasant Wizard devotes himself to the promotion of equality and justice. The Peasant Wizard is the most frequently encountered of all the wizards. There a
re no additional ability requirements for the Peasant Wizard. No special rules exist for abandoning this kit. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Preferred Schools:}{\fs24  There are no preferred schools for the Peasant Wizard, though illusionists, abjurers, and invokers are among the most frequently encountered. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Barred Schools:}{\fs24  There are no barred schools for the Peasant Wizard; however, there are fewer necromancers and diviners than any other specialist. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Role:}{\fs24  The Peasant Wizard fights on behalf of the common people. He considers h
imself protector of the helpless, actively opposing any action from the party that threatens or exploits the peasants. For instance, he won't allow his party to recruit peasants for combat support unless they fully understand the risks involved. When a co
m
panion of the Peasant Wizard bargains with a common man for goods or services, the Peasant Wizard makes sure his companion pays the common man a fair price. When the party recovers a treasure, the Peasant Wizard demands that the local citizens receive the
ir fair share if they helped the party in any way or if the treasure was recovered on their land. 
\par      The Peasant Wizard sees the wealthy classes as a primary reason for the commoners' miseries, so he has little respect or patience for noblemen and the we
althy. Aside from the occasional insult, the Peasant Wizard is likely to avoid associating with any Patricians in his party. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Secondary Skills:}{\fs24  The player may choose his Peasant Wizard's secondary skill. The DM might consider limiting this choice to s
kills that are useful to peasants such as swimming; it is unlikely (but not impossible) that a peasant wizard could learn heraldry or etiquette. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Weapon Proficiency:}{\fs24  Required (player's choice): Bow (any), dagger, knife, spear, dart, sling. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Nonweapon Proficiency:}{\fs24 
 Bonus (one of the following, player's choice: Agriculture, Fishing. Recommended: (General) Animal Handling, Blacksmithing, Carpentry, Cobbling, Cooking, Direction Sense, Fire-building, Leatherworking, Pottery, Riding (Land-based), Stonema
sonry, Weather Sense, Weaving. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Equipment:}{\fs24  The Peasant Wizard can spend his money on anything he likes, within the limitations described in the Special Hindrances entry below. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Special Benefits:}{\fs24  When in his homeland, the Peasant Wizard will alway
s be given food and shelter at no charge from his fellow commoners. This courtesy extends to the Peasant Wizard's companions, as long as he vouches for them. The Peasant Wizard does not receive this benefit in lands other than his own, but he always recei
ves a +2 reaction modifier from peasants in any culture. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Special Hindrances: }{\fs24 Aside from weapons, a Peasant Wizard may own only one item worth as much as 15 gp. Aside from this item, all of his other items must be valued at 10 gp or less. The total val
ue of all his possessions, including money but excluding weapons, can never exceed 75 gp. Any treasure or possessions in excess of this limit must be donated to some worthy cause. 
\par }{\b\fs24      Wealth Options:}{\fs24  The Peasant Wizard receives only (1d4 + 1) x 5 gp for starting money. 
\par }{\b\fs24      Races:}{\fs24  No restrictions.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Savage Wizard}{\fs24 
\par 
\par     }{\b\fs24  Description:}{\fs24  The Savage Wizard is the spell caster of a remote tribe, culturally and technologically primitive by the standards of the rest of the world. Although these tribes commonly main
tain functional civilizations for thousands of years, their traditions, dress, and customs are so simple that most outsiders consider them unsophisticated brutes. 
\par      There are a variety of Savage tribes around the world, ranging from pacifistic societie
s of farmers and herders to bloodthirsty headhunters and barbarians. All, however, are sharply attuned to the natural world, sharing a deep respect for animal and plant life and an innate understanding of the mysteries of nature. 
\par      To be a Savage Wizard, a character must have a minimum Strength score of 11 and a minimum Constitution score of 13. 
\par      To abandon this kit, a character must renounce his membership with his tribe and become a citizen of a different culture. Since tribal roots run deep, a d
ramatic change such as this should be slow in coming; a Savage Wizard must have advanced at least five levels since leaving his tribe and experiencing adventures in the outside world before cutting ties with his tribe. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Preferred Schools:}{\fs24  Because their Constitutions tend to be exceptionally high, Savage Wizards excel in the schools of conjuration/summoning and invocation/evocation. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Barred Schools:}{\fs24  Savage Wizards lack the natural aptitude for mastering the schools of abjuration and enchantment/charm. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Role:}{\fs24 
 Most tribesmen are dazzled and impressed by magic, so the Savage Wizard typically holds a position of great power in his tribe. If not the actual ruler, the Savage Wizard is a respected teacher or tribal counselor. Depending on the nature o
f the tribe, the Savage Wizard is known by a variety of names, among them Witch Doctor, Mundunugu, Wangateur, and Isangoma. 
\par      The Savage Wizard's power can sometimes work against him, particularly if his tribe is exceptionally superstitious or if an am
bitious tribesman schemes to usurp the wizard's leadership role. If the tribe becomes convinced that the wizard is consorting with demons or otherwise stirring up dark forces better left alone, they may expel the wizard from the tribe with the threat of e
xecution if he returns. This is one way that a Savage Wizard might link up with an adventuring party. 
\par      In a campaign, the Savage Wizard takes the role of an outsider, baffled and intimidated by the mysteries of the "civilized" world. Products of techno
logy, such as oil lanterns and crossbows, both fascinate and frighten him. While he is at home in the darkest jungles or most treacherous mountains, he is extremely uncomfortable in cities and towns. If the Savage Wizard is from a relatively pacifistic tr
ibe, he might serve as the conscience of his party, questioning their eagerness to kill, their obsession with wealth, their selfishness, and their inequitable system of justice. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Secondary Skills:}{\fs24  The Savage Wizard's Secondary Skill should be based on 
the primary occupation of his tribe; that is, if his tribe is mostly fishermen, his Secondary Skill should be Fishing. Other likely skills include Forester, Groom, Hunter, and Trapper/Furrier. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Weapon Proficiency:}{\fs24  Required (one of the following, repre
senting his tribe's weapon of choice): spear, blowgun, dagger, knife, or sling. Regardless of whether the Savage Wizard eventually becomes familiar with new weapons, he is likely to prefer his tribal weapon throughout his adventuring career. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Nonweapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24 
 (General) Direction Sense or Weather Sense (player choice); (Warrior) Endurance or Survival. Recommended: (General) Animal Handling, Animal Training, Fire-Building, Fishing, Riding (Land- based), Rope Use, Swimming; (Warrior, double slots)
 Animal Lore, Bowyer/Fletcher, Hunting, Mountaineering, Running, Set Snares, Tracking; (Priest, double slots) Healing, Local History; (Rogue, double slots) Jumping, Tightrope Walking, Tumbling; (Wizard) Herbalism, Religion. A Savage Wizard cannot take Eti
quette or Heraldry when first created. 
\par     }{\b\fs24  Equipment:}{\fs24  The only weapon the Savage Wizard can purchase initially is his tribal weapon (see Weapon Proficiency). He must spend all of his remaining gold when he is created; he may not keep any unspent gold. He 
can purchase only equipment that would normally be available to his tribe; for instance, his tribe probably has herbs, nuts, fishing nets, and rafts available, but they are unlikely to have chains, lanterns, hourglasses, or magnifying glasses. The DM has 
the final word as to what equipment is available to any particular Savage Wizard. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Special Benefits:}{\fs24  The Savage Wizard receives one of the following special abilities from the list below. The special ability is chosen when the character is first created and can never be changed. 
\par      1. The Savage Wizard can manufacture a protective talisman once per week. The talisman is a small pouch of herbs hung on a leather cord which is worn around the subject's neck. The talisman gives}{\i\fs24  protection from evil}{\fs24  to th
e wearer, identical to the effects of the 1st-level wizard spell. The talisman offers continual protection for a full day, after which time the herbs disintegrate. }{\i\fs24 Dispel magic}{\fs24 
 or a similar spell permanently cancels the magic of that particular talisman. The Savage Wizard requires no less than one hour to manufacture a talisman. 
\par      2. Once per week, the Savage Wizard can construct a small replicant of any single victim of his choice. The replicant is about 6 inches tall, made of clay, and crudely resembl
es the form of the victim. It must also contain a lock of hair, a fingernail, or other small piece of organic material from the victim. A Savage Wizard requires one hour to manufacture a replicant. 
\par      Whenever the Savage Wizard cuts a piece from the rep
licant, sticks a pin in it, or otherwise "attacks" it, the replicant suffers 1-4 hit points of damage. The victim who is represented by the replicant suffers an identical amount of damage, regardless of the distance between the replicant and the victim (h
o
wever, the victim must be on the same plane of existence as the replicant). Every type of damage on the replicant inflicts 1-4 hit points of damage; therefore, the Savage Wizard must take care not to destroy the replicant, for burning, crushing, or throwi
ng the replicant into a pool of quicksand still inflicts only 1-4 hit points of damage. The replicant disintegrates when any of the following conditions are met:

. To be receptive to an omen, the wizard must do nothing but concentrate for one uninterrupted turn; if his concentration is broken, he cannot attempt to interpret an omen for another week. After the turn of concentration, he studies his surroundings for 
an omen-- a rippling pond, a gathering of clouds, a swarm of insects, or the veins in a leaf are all possible sources of omens. 
\par      A wizard usually consults an omen before starting a journey, engaging in a major battle, or embarking on some other signifi
cant task. If the DM has knowledge about the proposed action, the omen should reveal the appropriate information; for instance, if the party is considering exploring an abandoned building, but the DM knows it contains a spectre, the result should be an il
l omen. In situations where the DM has no information on which to base his judgement, roll 1d10 and consult Table 7.

\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Witch
\par }{\fs24 
\par }{\b\fs24      Description:}{\fs24 
 The Witch is a wizard whose powerful magical abilities are extraplanar in origin. Though wizards typically learn the basics of spellcasting at magic academies or from learned mentors, Witches learn magical skills from entities and their minions from oth
er planes of existence, or from other Witches. 
\par      Occasionally, these extraplanar entities contact youthful humans or demihumans for magical instruction; other times, humans and demihumans seek out the entities through arcane rituals and petition them f
or instruction. The entities agree to such instruction for a variety of reasons-- some hope to train their students to eventually become emissaries; some hope to use them as conduits for various forces; some hope to seduce them as consorts; and some simpl
y share their magical secrets for their own amusement. 
\par      Whatever the motives of the extraplanar entities, they exude a powerful directing influence over their students. However, a few Witches with particularly strong wills are able to maintain their ow
n drives while using their magical skills to further their own goals. Such Witches face a life-long struggle with the forces who relentlessly strive to direct their spirits. 
\par      The requirements for becoming a Witch are higher than for any other kit. Bec
ause her training is more demanding than that received by most other wizards, she must have a minimum Intelligence and Wisdom of 13. To resist the corruption inherent from contact with extraplanar entities, she must have a minimum Constitution of 13. The 
vast majority of Witches are female, but male Witches are also possible, commonly called Warlocks. 
\par      The Witch kit cannot be abandoned. If a Witch manages to sever all ties with the entities responsible for her instruction (usually requiring the power of a}{\i\fs24  wish}{\fs24 
 or its equivalent), she loses two experience levels. If she still wishes to pursue a magical career, she must relearn the experience levels that she lost. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Preferred Schools:}{\fs24  The most appropriate school for Witches is enchantment/charm. Conjuration/summoning and necromancy are also good choices. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Barred Schools:}{\fs24  There are no barred schools for Witches. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Role:}{\fs24  Regardless of her actual alignment, all but her closest friends are likely to presume that a Witch is in collaboration with ex
traplanar spirits, and will shun her accordingly. There are few places where a Witch is welcome, and for the most part, a Witch will need to conceal her identity when traveling to assure her safety. 
\par      A Witch's player character companions need not have
 such fears or prejudices against her, especially after she proves herself in life-and-death situations. However, there might always be a veil of suspicion between the Witch and her companions, as if they cannot quite bring themselves to trust her complet
e
ly. Any player characters with suspicious natures, particularly those with primitive or unsophisticated backgrounds, may never fully warm up to a Witch and will avoid being alone with her, sometimes even accusing her of betraying the party or bringing the
m
 bad luck. (The DM is free to encourage this type of role-playing, but not to the point of disrupting the campaign. If this distrust becomes problematic, the DM might remind the PC leader of the party that the Witch is indeed a good-aligned character and 
it is his job to promote good will among his companions.)
\par      Although a Witch learns her magical techniques from extraplanar entities, once on her own, she learns her spells in much the same way as any other wizard. Still, her techniques for casting spell
s may differ significantly from the standard methods. The casting times, ranges, and effects of her spells are no different from the same spells used by other wizards, but she may use different verbal, somatic, or material components, as well as meditatio
n. These differences should make her seem even more threatening to outsiders, as well as making her seem more remote to the other player characters. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Secondary Skills:}{\fs24  Required: None. Recommended: Scribe. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Weapon Proficiency:}{\fs24  The Witch is not allowed an initial Weapon Proficiency, nor can she acquire a Weapon Proficiency as she advances in level. 
\par     }{\b\fs24  Nonweapon Proficiency:}{\fs24  Bonus Proficiencies: Herbalism, Spellcasting. Recommended: (General) Artistic Ability, Brewing, Cooking, Languages (Modern), 
Weather Sense; (Wizard) Ancient History, Astrology, Languages (Ancient), Reading/Writing, Religion; (Priest, double slot) Healing. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Equipment:}{\fs24  When a Witch is first created, she must buy her weapons from among the following choices: Dagger or dirk, kn
ife, sling, staff sling. Additionally, the Witch can choose up to 1,500 gp worth of magical items from Table 89 (Potions and Oils), Table 91 (Rings), Table 92 (Rods), Table 93 (Staves), Table 94 (Wands), and Tables 95- 103 (Miscellaneous Magic) on pages 1
35-139 of the }{\i\fs24 Dungeon Master's Guide}{\fs24 . These items are free-- she doesn't have to pay for them (but she cannot keep any of the leftover 1,500 gp). 
\par      }{\b\fs24 Special Benefits:}{\fs24  When a Witch is initially created, she automatically gains the spells }{\i\fs24 detect magic}{\fs24  and}{\i\fs24  read magic}{\fs24 
; these spells are in addition to any spells she normally receives. As a Witch increases in level, she automatically gains the following abilities. These are all naturally acquired abilities, and do not count against the number of spells she can 
know or use. All of the following abilities can be used once per week. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 3rd Level:}{\fs24  The Witch acquires the ability to }{\i\fs24 secure familiar}{\fs24 . This is identical to the 1st-level wizard spell}{\i\fs24  find familiar}{\fs24 , except that a Witch does not need to burn 1,000 gp wor
th of incense and herbs in a brass brazier. Instead, the Witch must merely concentrate for one turn. If a suitable familiar is within 1 mile per level of the Witch, it will arrive within 1d10 hours. A Witch can have only one familiar at a time. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 5th Level:}{\fs24  The Witch acquires the ability to }{\i\fs24 brew calmative}{\fs24 . Assuming she has access to the proper ingredients (usually available in any forest), the Witch can brew one dose of an elixir that has the effect of a }{
\i\fs24 sleep}{\fs24  spell when a victim comes in contact with i
t. One dose is sufficient to coat a sword or any other single weapon. The elixir has no effect on victims with more than 8 HD; victims can resist the effects of the elixir with a successful saving throw. 
\par      The Witch requires one hour to brew the elixir. The elixir loses its potency after 24 hours. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 7th Level:}{\fs24  The Witch acquires the ability to }{\i\fs24 brew poison}{\fs24 . With the proper ingredients, available in most forests, she can brew one dose of Class L contact poison sufficient to coat a single weapon. The W
itch requires one hour to brew the poison. It loses its potency in 24 hours. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 9th Level:}{\fs24  The Witch acquires the ability to }{\i\fs24 beguile }{\fs24 any single person or monster (assuming the person is no higher than 8th-level or the monster has no more than 8 HD). }{\i\fs24 Beguile }{\fs24 
is identical to the 4th-level wizard spell charm monster and the 1st-level wizard spell }{\i\fs24 charm person}{\fs24 , except that the victim is not allowed a saving throw. To cast }{\i\fs24 beguile}{\fs24 
, the Witch must merely point at the victim and concentrate for 1 round; there are no verbal or material components. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 11th Level:}{\fs24  The Witch acquires the ability to }{\i\fs24 brew flying ointment}{\fs24 . Assuming she has access to the proper ingredients (usually available in any forest), the Witch can brew one dose of an ointment which, when rubbe
d on the skin, gives the recipient the ability to fly, as per the 3rd-level wizard spell}{\i\fs24  fly}{\fs24 
. The dose is sufficient to affect one human-sized subject; the effects persist until the ointment loses its potency 24 hours after it is brewed. The Witch requires one hour to brew the ointment. 
\par      }{\b\fs24 13th Level:}{\fs24  The Witch acquires the ability to inflict a }{\i\fs24 witch's curse}{\fs24  on any single person or creature. This is exactly identical to the 4th-level wizard spell }{\i\fs24 bestow curse}{\fs24 
, except that its effect is automatic; the victim is not allowed a saving throw. The effect of the curse persists for 24 hours unless the curse is dispelled by a}{\i\fs24  remove curse, wish}{\fs24 
, or similar spell. To cast the spell, the Witch must merely point at the victim and concentrate for 1 round; no verbal or material components are required. To determine the effects of }{\i\fs24 witch's curse}{\fs24 , roll 1d8 and consult Table 8.

itch receives a -3 reaction roll. If the NPC is uneducated, comes from an extremely superstitious or unsophisticated culture, or has low Intelligence and Wisdom (under 10 for both), the Witch receives a -5 reaction roll. Additionally, if a Witch lingers i
n
 a superstitious or culturally unsophisticated community for more than a day, she runs the risk of facing a mob of hostile citizens bent on running her out of town, imprisoning her, torturing her, or executing her. (The DM decides the size of the mob, the
i
r intentions, and the likelihood of their accosting the Witch. As a rule of thumb, assume a 20 percent chance of a 4d6-member mob forming in a hostile community if the Witch stays for a day. This chance increases by 20 percent for every additional day the
 Witch remains; the size of the mob increases by 2d6 members.)

The Witch must periodically struggle with the extraplanar forces striving to direct her. The forces are so powerful that they cannot be dispelled; all the Witch can do is endure them. When unde
rgoing these internal struggles, the Witch suffers penalties to her combat abilities and saving throws. 
\par \tab The DM has three options for determining the frequency and intensity of these penalties, depending on the needs of his campaign and how much bookkeeping he is willing to undertake:
\par \tab 1. The Witch suffers a -2 penalty to her attack rolls and a -2 penalty to her saving throws on any night with a full moon and the three nights before and after the full moon (the penalties apply to a 12 hour period from abou
t 6 p. m. to 6 a. m. ). On most worlds, a full moon will occur about once per month; if the moon of the DM's world has a shorter or longer cycle, increase or decrease the number of nights the Witch is affected; she should be affected about seven nights ou
t of 4 weeks. If there are several moons, the Witch is affected by only one of them. 
\par \tab 2. There is a 25 percent chance per day that the Witch will be subjected to an internal struggle with extraplanar forces. The DM determines this at the beginning of the d
ay; the Witch is aware of the result. Throughout that night (a 12-hour period lasting from about 6 p. m. to 6 a. m.), the Witch suffers a -2 penalty to her attack rolls and a -2 penalty to her saving throws. 
\par \tab 3. The Witch struggles with the extraplanar forces every night. For a 12- hour period lasting from about 6 p. m. to 6 a. m. , she suffers a -1 penalty to her attack throws; there is no penalty to her saving throws.

 expand on the Witch's relationship with the entities who originally trained her. What exactly are they? Where are they? Can the Witch contact them for favors? What exactly happens if the forces succeed in controlling the Witch? Does her alignment change?

\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Wu Jen
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Description:}{\fs24  The Wu Jen is a wizard from cultures based on medieval oriental civilizations. He is a sorcerer of mysterious power and uncertain fealty. Unlike the oriental samurai, the Wu Jen seldom answers to a lord or master. His 
primary allegiance is to himself and to his craft. 
\par \tab The Wu Jen seldom lives among the masses, preferring instead to dwell in the wilderness where he can contemplate the secrets of nature without interruption. Living the life of a hermit, the Wu Jen concen
trates on purifying his body and mind, thus making him more receptive to the supernatural forces of the world. 
\par \tab To be a Wu Jen, a wizard must have an Intelligence of at least 13. He cannot be of lawful alignment, but may still be good, evil, or neutral. The Wu Jen kit cannot be abandoned. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Preferred Schools:}{\fs24  Wu Jen prefer the schools of conjuration/summoning, alteration, and invocation/evocation. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Barred Schools:}{\fs24  There are no barred schools for the Wu Jen. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Role:}{\fs24  Unless the campaign has an eastern setti
ng, the DM, in conjunction with the player, should invent a plausible explanation for the Wu Jen's appearance so far from home. Perhaps the Wu Jen is on a religious pilgrimage. Perhaps a magical device or spell transported the Wu Jen to the western world,
 either intentionally or unintentionally. Or perhaps the Wu Jen is on a decade-long quest for knowledge or self-awareness, and his travels have brought him to the other player characters. 
\par \tab Whatever the reason, the Wu Jen should add a touch of oriental intr
igue and exotic culture to a western-based party. His fellow player characters should find the Wu Jen's habits strange and fascinating. For instance, a Wu Jen prefers to record his spells on scrolls instead of in spell books. Perhaps he prays to the sun f
o
r an hour each day at dawn, or maybe he eats only roots and berries. A Wu Jen keeps his emotions hidden, and his motives are equally difficult to discern. It is unlikely that the Wu Jen shares the party's goals and moral code; if he agrees to join the par
ty, it is probably due to his intellectual curiosity. 
\par \tab The DM is within his rights to forbid Wu Jen from the campaign. Before a player selects this kit, he must check with the DM to make sure that Wu Jen are allowed. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Secondary Skills:}{\fs24  Required: Scribe. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Weapon Proficiency:}{\fs24 
 Required (choose one of the following): Blowgun, short bow, dagger, dart, sling. Alternately, the Wu Jen can choose from the selection of oriental weapons listed in Table 9. The Wu Jen has an automatic and permanent +1 bonus to hit whe
never using the weapon he has chosen for his Weapon Proficiency. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Nonweapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24  Bonus Proficiencies: Etiquette, Artistic Ability (Painting, Calligraphy, or Origami). Recommended: (General) Riding (Land-based), Cooking, Dancing, Singing; (Wizard
) Astrology, Herbalism, Spellcraft; (Priest, double slot) Musical Instrument; (Rogue, double slot) Blind-fighting, Gaming, Juggling, Tumbling. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Equipment:}{\fs24  The Wu Jen must buy all weapons from the choices listed in the Weapon Proficiency entry above. He may have no more than 10 gp remaining when he has finished purchasing his equipment. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Special Benefits:}{\fs24  When a Wu Jen reaches 4th level, he gains the power to summon massive magical energies that allow him to cast any one spell that is three or more levels 
lower than his level at maximum effect. The spell automatically has maximum range, (if desired), duration, and effect. Thus, a 4th-level Wu Jen can cast a 1st-level spell at maximum effect. A Wu Jen can use this ability once per day. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Special Hindrances:}{\fs24  
The Wu Jen operates under special taboos that do not affect other characters. Though the taboos may seem trivial or even ridiculous to other characters, the Wu Jen takes them quite seriously-- violating a taboo causes the Wu Jen to lose levels of ability,
 
lose spells, become ill, or even die (the DM decides the exact penalty). A 1st-level Wu Jen has one taboo and gains an additional taboo every five levels thereafter (at 6th level, 11th level, and so on). The DM selects the taboos. Some suggestions follow;

\par Bo stick: A staff of hard wood that is very difficult to break and is normally 6-7 feet in length.
\par Boku-toh: A wooden replica of a short sword, usually used for practice since it cannot cut or slash. Used aggressively, it can cause bludgeoning damage.
\par Jitte: A tapered iron bar with a short hook near the handle. Although the hook is not sharp enough to cut or pierce, the jitte can be used to strike blows.
\par Shuriken: A small throwing weapon in the shape of a star with need
le-like projections. They are thrown by hand and easily concealed in folds of clothing. A large-star shuriken has a fire rate of 3, a short range of 5 yards, a medium range of 10 yards, and a long range of 20 yards.

\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Recording Kits on the Character Sheet}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab To record a wizard kit on character record sheets, follow these steps:
\par \tab 1. In the space where the character's school is recorded, add the name of his wizard kit. 
\par \tab 2. When recording the character's Nonweapon Proficiencies, add the bonus proficiencies the character receives from his wizard kit. Mark the bonus proficiencies with an asterisk to indicate that they are free. 
\par \tab 3. Make notes about the character's special benefits and hindrances and other pertinent information in any available space on the sheet
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 
\par Modifying the Kits
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab The DM is encouraged to modify the kits to more accurately represent the history, cultures, and events of his campaign world. 
\par \tab However, he should not violate the nature of the kit; males should not be allowed to be members of the Am
azon kit, nor should Patricians be allowed to be necromancers. Common sense must prevail. However, if there are no oriental or eastern-styled cultures in his world, the DM is free to disallow the Wu Jen kit. Similarly, if a natural disaster wiped out all 
traces of Amazon society in his world, he can disallow the Amazon kit
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Creating New Kits}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab Using the kits above as guidelines, many new kits can be created. If the DM has a certain type of wizard that he would like in his world, he should design a Wizard Ki
t for that personality. To design a Wizard Kit, the DM should consider the following questions about the wizard and his role in the campaign. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Description:}{\fs24  What's this wizard like? Is he drawn from a specific literary, mythological, or historical source? Are there any special requirements for a character who wishes to be this type of wizard? 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Role:}{\fs24  What place does this wizard have in the campaign? How is he regarded by his own culture? By other cultures? Is there a particular attitude or outlook he needs to belong to this Wizard Kit? 
\par \tab What kinds of activities does this wizard tend to perform in a campaign-- is he a bold man of action? A withdrawn scholar? An impulsive show-off? What is his relationship with the other characters-- is he friendly, distanced, wary, impassive? 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Preferred and Barred Schools:}{\fs24 
 Are there certain types of specialties that seem especially appropriate to the wizards described in your kit? If so, note them as preferred schools. Are there other specialists that seem particularly inapp
ropriate to your kit? Note them as barred schools. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Secondary Skills:}{\fs24  If using the Secondary Skills system, you need to decide if this Wizard Kit requires such a skill. If there isn't a particular secondary skill or skills common to all wizards of this ty
pe, then do not require a secondary skill. But if all members of a Wizard Kit share the same skill-- or one of a small number of skills-- then you might require it of all characters who take this kit. \tab 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Weapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24  Often, certain types of wizard
s tend to favor certain types of weapons. Others select their weapons from a wide range of choices. If the wizard described in your kit seems to prefer one or two weapons more than others, note this in the kit. Keep in mind, however, that all wizards shar
e certain weapon restrictions-- see Chapter 5. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Nonweapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24  As with weapon proficiencies, many wizards tend to have certain skills in common. For instance, it would be hard to imagine a Patrician who wasn't skilled in Etiquette. Therefore, one
 or two nonweapon proficiency slots can be given free of charge to characters taking this kit. If appropriate, the proficiencies can come from the Priest, Rogue, and Warrior listings. Normally, the cost in slots for non-wizard proficiences would be higher
, but this can be ignored when kits are being given free. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Equipment:}{\fs24  If a wizard is known for using certain types of equipment, require that such a character have this equipment before the campaign begins. If some but not all wizards of this type use the 
same equipment, then it needn't be required; instead, simply list it as recommended equipment. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Special Benefits:}{\fs24  Although not necessary, most Wizard Kits should have some special benefit. Any kind of benefit is acceptable, but it should relate to the way
 this wizard operates in fiction, mythology, or similar source material. Possible benefits could include:

\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Wizard Kit Creation Sheet
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab At the end of this book is a blank Kit Creation Sheet. Copies of this sheet may be made to help you design new kits. The DM or players can design new kits appropriate to the char
acter types they would like to play. However, if a player designs his own kit, he should check all details of the kit with his DM. The DM may make changes, or he may disallow the kit altogether
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Suggestions for New Kits
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab Here are a few ideas that might be developed into new kits:
\par \tab Dragon Master (a wizard with a special affinity for dragons and the magic they use)
\par \tab Outlaw Wizard (a wizard who is rightly or wrongly wanted by the law)
\par \tab Spiritualist (a wizard with a special interest in ghosts, spirits, and extraplanar phenomena)
\par \tab Nomad (a rootless wizard with no permanent homeland)

\par }{\b\fs32\cf2 Chapter 4: Role-Playing}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab Your wizard character now has a specialty, an interesting variety of low-level spells, a nice set of proficiencies, and a kit from the previous chapter. 
\par \tab 
Ready to adventure? Not quite. There's more to role-playing a wizard than casting spells, checking proficiencies, and swinging a staff at the bad guys. In this chapter, we present suggestions for role-playing techniques that will help your character come 
to life
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Wizard Personalities}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab No two wizards are alike. They may have the same specialties, the same spells, even the same backgrounds, yet each has his own set of quirks, flaws, goals, and interests that make him a unique personality. 
\par \tab This chapter provides descriptions of different wizard personalities drawn from fantasy literature and mythology. Players should look at them all and see if any of the descriptions fit their conceptions of their characters. 
\par \tab Each player should think about what his character would be like if he actually existed-- would he be bold or cautious? Greedy or generous? Considerate or selfish? Thoughtful? Impulsive? Flamboyant?
\par \tab If any of the personality types listed seem right for your character, feel free to use the description a
s a basis for making role-playing decisions about a PC's actions and goals. The descriptions can also be used to help decide how a PC interacts with NPCs and with other members of his party. If none of these descriptions seem exactly right for your charac
ter, perhaps one or more of them will inspire you to create a new personality type. 
\par \tab Each personality description below includes the following information:
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24 \tab Character Description:}{\fs24  This section describes the character's general attitudes, motivations, and 
outlook, and how he is most likely to function in a typical campaign. In some cases, suggestions are given as to what types of players might find this particular personality type the most enjoyable to play. 
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24 \tab Best Suited For:}{\fs24  Some personality types are more appropriate for certain alignments than others, and some are more appropriate for certain kits than others. This information is provided here.
\par \tab These are only recommendations, not hard and fast rules, and using alignments and kits other than the ones s
uggested might require some imaginative rationale on the part of the DM and the player. For instance, an Entertainer/Savage Wizard could exist, but he will probably be rare in a typical campaign world. Novice players are advised to remain within the align
ment and kit recommendations in this section. 
\par 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 In Combat Situations: }{\fs24 Each personality type approaches combat situations in a slightly different fashion. Some might charge straight ahead with their weapons swinging, while others might hold back to size up 
the enemy before committing to a course of action. Some might cast their strongest spells first, others might hold them in reserve. This section details each personality type's combat style. 
\par 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 In Role-Playing Situations:}{\fs24  This section explains how the char
acter is likely to react when encountering NPCs. These suggestions should be used as guidelines when role-playing conversations, including interrogations, interviews, and small talk. This section will also give an idea how the character might interact wit
h the other player characters. 
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 The Altruist}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Character Description:}{\fs24  The Altruist is a selfless humanitarian, his actions fueled by a passion for justice. The Altruist regards his magical skills as a special gift to be used to promote the common good, and
 he devotes his life to the welfare of others. He is admired by the oppressed, scorned by oppressors, and respected by all. Because his goals are simple and his values are unambiguous, this personality type is a particularly easy one to play. It is a good
 choice for characters of beginning players. Experienced players, however, may find him a bit boring, and the DM should be aware that an entire party of Altruists can lead to a lifeless campaign. 
\par 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Best Suited For:}{\fs24  Any kit is appropriate for the Altruist. Obviously, this type of character should be of good alignment, lawful good being the most frequently encountered. 
\par 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 In Combat Situations:}{\fs24  The Altruist is a courageous, aggressive combatant. He is as selfless on the battlefield as he is in all other walks of life; if an Altruist has a single }{\i\fs24 protection from evil}{\fs24 
 spell, he will cast it on the most vulnerable member of his party, using it on himself only if he's absolutely certain that all of his companions are safe. He attacks honorably and with mercy, accep
ting the surrender of his opponents whenever possible. He assumes leadership roles if necessary, though he seldom seeks them. 
\par 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 In Role-Playing Situations:}{\fs24  The Altruist is polite, even-tempered, and thoughtful. He has little patience for liars and cheater
s, and NPCs who exploit the helpless are especially repugnant to him. Most NPCs, except those of evil alignment, admire and respect the Altruist's strong moral code, but some NPCs may see him as self-righteous and pompous. 
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 The Brooder}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Character Description:}{\fs24 
 The Brooder is tormented with self-doubt; he worries about his relationship with the rest of the universe, where he fits in with the rest of mankind, and the meaning of his own existence. He may dwell for days on the ramifications of some seemingly i
nsignificant action. If he makes a wrong decision or a decision he perceives as being wrong, he may become consumed with self-loathing, spiraling into a deep depression that can persist for weeks. Holding himself to impossibly high standards, the Brooder 
is continually disappointed with his performance as a wizard, a citizen, and as a human being. 
\par \tab Obsessed with perfection, the Brooder tends to be an extremely skilled spell caster and combatant. His mind is sharp and his actions are precise and correct. Al
though he usually succeeds at whatever he attempts, his accomplishments seem to bring him little fulfillment or joy. 
\par \tab Not surprisingly, the Brooder's outlook on life is dismal. He believes the struggle between good and evil can never be won; it will conti
nue to claim victims on both sides for all eternity. Friendship is valued but transient; a friend today can be an enemy tomorrow. Acts of courage and selflessness are admirable but ultimately futile. Existence is a tragic joke-- men are only puppets in th
e hands of incomprehensibly cruel gods. 
\par \tab Because the Brooder seldom voices his opinions, this personality is a good choice for players who tend to be quiet. Conversely, the Brooder is a nice change of pace for players who normally take charge. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Best Suited For:}{\fs24 
 Because the Brooder tends to reject moral absolutes, he gravitates toward neutral alignments, particularly neutral good and chaotic neutral. The Brooder can use any kit, but the Academician, the Mystic, and the Wu Jen are especially good choices. 
\par 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 In Combat Situations:}{\fs24 
 The Brooder is an excellent fighter. Cowardice is unknown to him; since he doesn't believe his own life is particularly precious, he fights as if he has nothing to lose. He is calm and clear-thinking in times of crisis, using his spe
lls to their maximum effectiveness. If necessary, he will unhesitatingly risk his life for a friend. 
\par \tab If the Brooder is preoccupied with a past mistake or a depressing philosophical revelation, he may be slow to join a battle. Likewise, if the Brooder is 
in a state of mind where the differences between good and evil seem especially ambiguous, he may decline to participate in a fight. Usually the Brooder can be roused to battle by a firm request from the party leader or the gentle urgings from a trusted co
mpanion. Even in the depths of despair, the Brooder will not stand idle and allow harm to come to his companions. 
\par 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 In Role-Playing Situations:}{\fs24  In most encounters with NPCs, the Brooder will remain quiet and distracted, leaving most of the talking to his c
ompanions. He is loathe to offer his opinion, and seldom cares to hear the opinions of others. Most of the time, he is simply apathetic. Most NPCs perceive the Brooder to be emotionless and preoccupied, and keep their distance. Sensitive NPCs might feel s
orry for him.
\par \tab  The Brooder's attitude can be extremely frustrating to his fellow player characters. Since he keeps to himself most of the time, usually his companions will only be able to guess what he's thinking or feeling. 
\par \tab Some PCs may attempt to befri
end him. Kindness and patience will eventually break through a Brooder's shell. Although he may not show it, the Brooder feels friendship deeply, and may even share his deepest thoughts with a companion who has been kind and caring
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 The Commander}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Character Description:}{\fs24 
 The Commander is a natural leader who exudes authority. This may be due to his upbringing, his training, his innate tendencies, his birth order (these types tend to be first-born), or any combination of these factors, but whatever the reaso
ns, taking charge comes automatically to the Commander. He is decisive, imposing, and inspiring. 
\par \tab The safety of his companions is of paramount importance to the Commander, and he feels personally responsible for their actions. The Commander is not always 
the leader of his party-- he understands that a leader cannot function without able followers-- but he always tends to act like one, issuing orders, taking charge, and showing initiative whenever others are slow to act. 
\par \tab Players selecting this type of character should be prepared to make most of the decisions for the group. If a player is uncomfortable with this role, he would do better to choose a different personality type. 
\par 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Best Suited For:}{\fs24  Lawful and neutral are the most appropriate alignments for Co
mmanders. Characters of evil alignment might demonstrate good leadership, but are too self-centered to fit the nature of this personality. Chaotic characters usually lack the necessary discipline needed for leadership. 
\par \tab A Commander can take the Amazon, An
agakok, Militant Wizard, Patrician, Peasant Wizard, Savage Wizard, or Wu Jen kit. Academicians tend to be too analytical and Mystics are too self-absorbed. Most Witches will have difficulty gaining the complete trust of their parties, though Witch Command
ers are certainly feasible. 
\par 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 In Combat Situations:}{\fs24  A Commander is a master tactician and superb strategist. In combat, his mind is constantly at work, looking for weaknesses in an enemy's defense, weighing attack options, considering the best positions fo
r friendly forces, and deciding when to withdraw and when to press ahead. Even if someone else is actually in charge, the Commander inevitably will be issuing orders and attempting to boost his party's morale. 
\par 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 In Role-Playing Situations:}{\fs24  Unless he is ou
tranked or asked to refrain, the Commander will presume to speak for the group in NPC encounters. He will negotiate a group rate for the party at an inn, and speak to the local authorities about recruiting extra men for an anticipated battle. Depending on
 his manner, NPCs may see the Commander as either arrogant or accommodating, but they will always be impressed with his self-confidence
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 The Counselor
\par }{\fs24 \tab 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Character Description:}{\fs24  The Counselor is a learned man of calm self-assurance who typically serves as an advisor to rulers, administrators, military men, and adventurers. 
\par \tab A Counselor is typically older than other adventurers and is usually more experienced, but could also be a younger character with a special talent for understanding human nature or a natural empathy. 
\par \tab A man of integrity and great dignity, he is respected not only for his knowledge, but also his insight into human behavior. He believes in moderation and justice, and has a helping hand and kind word for all. 
\par \tab The Counselor is a good choice
 for players who like to play thoughtful, even-tempered characters who are more apt to be advisors than leaders. Since novice and low-level characters lack the experience for this personality type, mid-level and high-level characters (especially those wit
h high Wisdom scores) are the best choices to be Counselors. 
\par 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Best Suited For:}{\fs24  Because a Counselor's relationship with others is based on trust, characters of good alignments are best suited for this personality type, especially lawful good characters. Ch
aotic good characters can function as Counselors as well, although this type of Counselor will be guided more by his own personal philosophies than by any accepted standards of law and moral values. Neutral characters tend to be too selfish; it is unlikel
y that other characters would turn to them for advice. Evil Counselors are not likely to be accepted in a party whose members are mostly good and/or lawful. 
\par \tab Any kit can be adapted to this personality type. The Academician is a logical choice, but the Myst
ic and Wu Jen also make good Counselors (the Wu Jen has much eastern wisdom to offer, while the Mystic is eager to share his insights into the human condition). 
\par 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 In Combat Situations:}{\fs24  The Counselor is a veteran of many battles, but because he is likely t
o be of advanced years, he is not the best physical combatant. He most likely will remain in a protected position, probably near the back of the party or in a good vantage point from which to cast spells. 
\par \tab The Counselor is also an excellent negotiator. Wh
enever possible, he will try to seek common ground with an aggressor in an attempt to avoid combat. The Counselor seldom takes the role of a military leader, but usually functions as the leader's chief advisor and consultant. 
\par 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 In Role-Playing Situations:}{\fs24 
 All but the most mean-spirited and evil-hearted NPCs will respect the Counselor for his wisdom and compassion. The Counselor will never turn his back on a person in trouble, and is forever making the problems of others his own. At the same time, the Coun
selor is a shrewd judge of character and is usually the first to spot a charlatan or a duplicitous NPC. 
\par \tab In a campaign, the Counselor is everybody's best friend. He always has time to hear his companions' problems, no matter how trivial, and serves as a source of both comfort and sage advice
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 The Intimidator
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Character Description:}{\fs24  Many believe that the wizard is the most powerful of all mortals-- the Intimidator is convinced of it. Radiating power and confidence, the Intimidator faces all challenges head 
on. There's no opponent too tough and no obstacle too difficult for him. His access to magic makes him superior to all others-- at least}{\i\fs24  he}{\fs24 
 believes this to be fact. His reaction to common people-- that is, people who cannot cast spells-- ranges from sympathy to impatience, but as long as they acknowledge his superiority, he can tolerate them. 
\par \tab Usually, this amount of confidence evolves over many years, so most Intimidators are mid-level or high-level wizards. But an especially powerful or an especially arrogant lower-level wizard might easily be an Intimidator. 
\par \tab An inflated ego alone is not enough-- this personality type is primarily intended for wizards who are in fact more powerful than their contemporaries. To qualify as an Intimidator, a wizard should
 have higher than normal scores in at least two abilities other than Intelligence (for instance, a wizard with Strength and Charisma scores of 12 or more would be a good candidate for an Intimidator). However, even if a character lacks exceptional abiliti
es, he might still be an Intimidator if he has a reputation as a no-nonsense aggressor and has the personality to match. 
\par 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Best Suited For:}{\fs24  The Intimidator is suited to any alignment, though characters of neutral and chaotic alignments might make better eg
omaniacs; neutral good, neutral evil, chaotic good, and chaotic neutral are all appropriate choices. 
\par \tab Any kits that suggest aggressive, grim characters are good for the Intimidator, with the Savage Wizard and the Militant Wizard being obvious choices. More passive types, such as the Mystic and Academician, are less appropriate for the Intimidator. 

\par 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 In Combat Situations:}{\fs24  The Intimidator loves nothing more than a good fight. He is a shrewd, dangerous opponent bent on extinguishing every one of his enemies. 
\par \tab Although he does not attack recklessly, the Intimidator prefers to face off with the most formidable opponent on the battlefield. Where some wizards might use}{\i\fs24  fireball}{\fs24 
 to frighten a group of opponents by sailing it over their heads, the Intimidator would scare them by firing it directly at their leader, incinerating him. 
\par 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 In Role-Playing Situations:}{\fs24  The Intimidator is accustomed to getting his way. If reason fails, he will threaten, frighten, or otherwise intimidate NPCs to get their cooperation, unless a player character companion intervenes. 

\par \tab The Intimidator is a man of few words. He knows that a snarl or a stare can be a much more effective way to coerce uncooperative NPCs than long speeches or kind words. Needless to say, the Intimidator is not esp
ecially adept at delicate negotiations. 
\par \tab In a campaign, all player characters will respect the Intimidator, but he's likely to associate only with player characters he sees as peers, such as high-level warriors and other wizards. The Intimidator will tend
 to be patronizing and condescending to the rest of the party, treating them as well-meaning children, incompetent bumblers, or outright irritants
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 The Mercenary 
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Character Description:}{\fs24  The Mercenary sees the adventuring life as a means to further his pe
rsonal wealth. He may accept a job with a party at a set salary or might agree to take a fixed share of any treasure the party finds. Any interest he has in the party's goals are secondary to his pocketbook. 
\par \tab Not all Mercenaries are interested in money. S
ome may be interested in acquiring souvenirs for their personal collections, while others may wish to hoard magical devices or fatten their spells books. In all cases, however, the Mercenary's first interest is in himself. 
\par \tab A Mercenary is not necessarily 
a criminal or a thief-- he prides himself in his professionalism and has no shame about his interest in wealth and material possessions. Since his motivations are straightforward, the Mercenary is a good personality type for novice players. 
\par 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Best Suited For: }{\fs24 
The Mercenary is best suited for neutral alignments, particularly neutral good and lawful neutral. Lawful good characters are less inclined to exploit others for personal gain, while evil characters are more likely to turn to criminal activities to in
crease their wealth. This personality type is suitable for any kit. 
\par 
\par  \tab }{\b\fs24 In Combat Situations:}{\fs24  The Mercenary is a good, professional combatant. He takes orders well, offers strategic suggestions when asked, and fights valiantly alongside his companions. How
ever, he will not volunteer for dangerous missions, nor will he unnecessarily risk his neck unless he gets extra pay or there's a chance of recovering an especially desirable treasure. 
\par 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 In Role-Playing Situations:}{\fs24  The Mercenary tends to let the other pla
yer characters do most of the negotiating and interacting with NPCs. He may take a more active role if he suspects an NPC has information about a treasure or about any of his other personal interests. Otherwise, there are no restrictions for the Mercenary
-- he can be humorous and personable, introverted and serious, or arrogant and obnoxious, as determined by the player
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 The Mystery Man}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Character Description:}{\fs24  The Mystery Man is a genuine enigma. Surrounded in a veil of secrecy, his motivations, his goals,
 and the details of his background are kept hidden from even his closest companions. He favors dark clothing and speaks only when necessary; his words are often cryptic or vague, suggesting that the Mystery Man knows far more than he chooses to reveal. 

\par \tab N
o one is certain why the Mystery Man behaves as he does. Perhaps it is due to an oath to an ancestor, or perhaps it is a neurotic compulsion. Whatever the reason, the Mystery Man is clearly determined to operate on his own terms. Consequently, the Mystery
 Man is a good personality type for players who feel comfortable with offbeat characters. 
\par 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Best Suited For:}{\fs24  The Mystery Man is perfectly suited for neutral alignments, especially neutral good and lawful neutral, but any alignments are possible. The Myster
y Man's reason for maintaining his veil of secrecy might suggest an appropriate alignment. For instance, if he has taken an oath to avenge the death of his spouse, he might be lawful good. If his magical aptitude makes him feel like an outcast from societ
y, but he still identifies with order and organization, he might be lawful neutral. If he conceals his identity because he is an escaped criminal, he might be lawful or neutral evil. 
\par \tab Any of the kits can be adapted to the Mystery Man. 
\par 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 In Combat Situations:}{\fs24 
 Typically, the Mystery Man listens impassively to the orders of his leaders, then fights as he chooses. The Mystery Man can be counted on to do the unexpected; as a battle gets underway, he may suddenly vanish, then abruptly appear in the midst of an o
pposing force. He might use }{\i\fs24 control undead}{\fs24  to command undead creatures to lift him to their shoulders and carry him into battle. He might}{\i\fs24  summon shadow}{\fs24  for a whispered conversation, dismiss the shadow, then use}{
\i\fs24  light}{\fs24  to make himself glow while he attacks an opponent. 
\par \tab While his fighting style is eccentric, it is startlingly effective. Opponents are usually baffled by the Mystery Man's tactics or are intimidated by his manner and appearance. For these reasons, the Mystery Man is a first-rate combatant. 
\par 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 In Role-Playing Situations:}{\fs24 
 The very presence of the Mystery Man is enough to make many NPCs uncomfortable. While he usually lets his companions do most of the talking, NPCs often are so intimidated by the Mystery Man that they are quick to cooperate just t
o get rid of him. Many NPCs of the opposite sex find that the Mystery Man's veil of secrecy makes him intriguing and extremely attractive. While polite and considerate to his companions, the Mystery Man has no interest in socializing with them.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 The Neophyte
\par }{\fs24 
\par }{\b\fs24 \tab Character Description:}{\fs24  The Neophyte is a young, low-level wizard: an inexperienced novice anxious to begin his life as an adventurer and excited about the prospects ahead. 
\par \tab However, the Neophyte's eagerness is more than matched by his naivete. He has
 seen little of the world outside of his homeland; when encountering new cultures or experiencing new situations, he may be confused and intimidated or curious and impulsive. Since he tends to overestimate his abilities and underestimate dangers, he const
antly gets himself into trouble. Still, his cheerful outlook and youthful enthusiasm endear the Neophyte to his companions, and he is a welcome member of any party, even if his friends usually have their hands full looking after him. 
\par \tab Hopefully, the Neophy
te will not be naive forever. With experience comes wisdom, and with wisdom comes sophistication. As a campaign progresses, the Neophyte should temper his impulsiveness with caution and his brashness with maturity. Therefore, this personality type is only
 
a temporary one-- at some point, the character will abandon the role of the Neophyte and grow into a different personality. The road from innocence to maturity is a fascinating one, making the Neophyte an excellent choice for novice wizards and beginning 
role-players. 
\par 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Best Suited For}{\fs24 : The entire range of neutral and good alignments are open to the Neophyte. Characters with evil alignments should be avoided-- they aren't trusting or naive enough to make enjoyable Neophyte characters. 
\par \tab Since all wizards begin their careers as novices, any kit suits the Neophyte, although the serious-minded Wu Jen and Academician are less likely to exhibit the Neophyte's enthusiasm and impulsiveness. 
\par 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 In Combat Situations:}{\fs24  The Neophyte has probably experienced little comb
at in his life, especially the life-threatening variety. Although understandably nervous, he is also determined to do his best and prove to his comrades that he is not just a child who needs to be protected. Unfortunately, this attitude often results in i
n
appropriate and ineffective tactics; the Neophyte is likely to charge his opponents head-on, regardless of their size or strength, or fire missile weapons at anything that moves. He might seem to cast spells at random, sometimes squandering his most power
ful magic on relatively defenseless foes. As an inexperienced spell caster, he is not familiar with sophisticated casting techniques; for instance, when faced with a charging wolf pack, he's more likely to use }{\i\fs24 magic missile}{\fs24 
 on a single wolf instead of casting it on a nearby cliff-face to cause an avalanche, thus destroying the entire pack. 
\par \tab Assuming his companions can keep him from accidentally killing himself, the Neophyte gradually learns from experience, becoming a more skillful combatant as he matures. 
Eager to learn, a Neophyte will make a good student to a more experienced comrade. An older and wiser PC wizard might wish to take a Neophyte under his wing to show him the ways of the world. 
\par 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 In Role-Playing Situations:}{\fs24  Generally, the Neophyte does not 
know how to act around NPCs, particularly those older than him. He might be shy and say nothing, or he might blurt out something inappropriate. Figures of authority intimidate him, smooth-talkers take advantage of him, and attractive members of the opposi
te sex reduce him to a blathering, stammering idiot. 
\par \tab The Neophyte tends to accept people on face value; he never guesses that a friendly stranger might be picking his pocket. Friendly, personable NPCs will find the Neophyte charming and amusing; impatient
, businesslike NPCs will find him exasperating and annoying
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 The Obsessive
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Character Description:}{\fs24  The Obsessive is motivated by a single, all-consuming goal. This goal might be learning a particular spell, locating a long-lost mentor, acquiring a particu
lar magical item or artifact, or avenging the death of a loved one. The goal might also be completely unrealistic, such as ridding the world of all evil, or filling his spell books with the formulas of every known spell. 
\par \tab The Obsessive focuses on the reso
lution of his goal to the exclusion of all else. He views his association with an adventuring party as a means to an end; for instance, he might join an adventuring party if he learns that they are journeying to a faraway kingdom where he believes an arti
fact might be located. The Obsessive cooperates with an adventuring party only to the extent that their goals don't conflict with his. 
\par \tab If his goal is realistic, it is unlikely that a character will remain an Obsessive forever. A player selecting this pers
onality type might want to choose a second personality type for his character once he reaches his goal. This second personality type might also suggest a goal for the Obsessive. For instance, if a character is a Commander at heart, he might become an Obse
ssive if he is consumed with finding an evil NPC responsible for killing all of his men. When he brings the NPC to justice, the Obsessive reverts to Commander. 
\par 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Best Suited For:}{\fs24  Characters of any alignment can be Obsessives, though certain obsessions are 
more appropriate for certain alignments. For instance, an Obsessive bent on avenging his daughter's murder probably has a strong sense of justice; he's probably of lawful alignment. A greedy Obsessive who seeks a legendary fortune in gold could be of a ne
utral alignment, possibly neutral evil. 
\par \tab Any kit can be used for the Obsessive. 
\par 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 In Combat Situations:}{\fs24  The Obsessive tends to be a brutal, savage fighter, since he sees opponents as another obstacle between him and his goal; he wants them out of the way 
as quickly as possible. Negotiation makes him impatient; he would rather blast his adversaries to bits with a }{\i\fs24 fireball}{\fs24 
 than waste time talking. That does not mean that the Obsessive takes unnecessary risks-- after all, he cannot reach his goal if he's dead
-- but he is prone to recklessness and can easily endanger his companions if he is not kept in check by a firm leader. 
\par 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 In Role-Playing Situations:}{\fs24  In all cases, the Obsessive is more concerned with his personal goal than the goal of the party. He'll que
stion NPCs intently for information about his goal, and if they have nothing to offer, he will seek out other NPCs to interview. If the party leader convinces him that he is operating to the detriment of the party's goals as well as his own, the Obsessive
 will restrain himself, but this will probably be only temporary. 
\par \tab In a campaign, the Obsessive is self-absorbed and humorless. He will talk incessantly to his companions about his own goal, but his eyes will glaze over when they share their problems or op
inions with him. The Obsessive's attitude does nothing to endear him to his companions, but depending on the nature of his goal, they may feel sympathy or compassion for him
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 The Showman}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Character Description:}{\fs24  No one enjoys being a wizard more than the S
howman. He delights in dazzling friends and foes alike with surprising, dramatic magical effects. Nothing stirs the heart of a Showman more than learning a new magical effect or putting a new twist on an old spell. He sees magic as a fine art, comparable 
to sculpting, composing, and painting. He has more appreciation for a well-executed cantrip than for a mundanely-cast 9th-level spell. 
\par \tab The Showman casts spells with a flair. He considers both opponents and allies as potential audiences. If a spell require
s a short phrase for its verbal component, he'll incorporate the phrase in a song or poem. If a spell requires him to point at a subject, he will use a series of elaborate and dramatic gestures to arrive at pointing his finger. His alteration spells are s
trikingly imaginative; his illusions are breathtaking works of art. Nothing frustrates a Showman more than having to use a spell in the same way twice, especially if his audience of friends or foes has seen it previously. 
\par \tab The Showman's flamboyance is easi
ly matched by his ego. He wallows in the approval of others; applause is like music to him, a compliment is like food to a starving man. However, even the most casual criticism can send him sulking and an insult can devastate him. 
\par \tab Most often, the Showman
 is cheerful and upbeat. Most people find him great fun to be around, and no one can argue that his approach to magic is genuinely entertaining. This is a good character type for players who want to introduce more humor and playfulness into a campaign. 

\par 
\par }{\b\fs24 Best Suited For:}{\fs24 
 The spontaneity typical of the chaotic alignments makes them good choices for the Showman, but good and evil alignments are appropriate (the good-aligned Showman loves to share his skills with others and bring smiles to their faces; the evi
l-aligned Showman enjoys frightening and intimidating them). The Showman is not likely to be drawn to the cautious and self-centered neutral alignments. 
\par \tab The Showman is best suited for the Amazon, Peasant Wizard, Witch, and Wu Jen kits. The Academician te
nds to be too cerebral, the Anagakok and the Militant Wizard too serious, the Savage Wizard too unsophisticated, the Mystic too introspective, and the Patrician too stuffy. 
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24 In Combat Situations:}{\fs24  The Showman relishes combat, since it gives him a perfect o
pportunity to show off his spells. Needless to say, the Showman will always go for the most spectacular, dramatic, and dazzling effects-- if he wants to scare away an opponent with }{\i\fs24 phantasmal force}{\fs24 
, why create a simple ogre or troll when he can create a mu
lti-headed werewolf with purple tentacles and 10-inch golden fangs? Unfortunately, his flair for the dramatic sometimes finds him squandering his higher-levels spells unnecessarily, such as in using}{\i\fs24  lightning bolt}{\fs24 
 when the less-spectacular }{\i\fs24 magic missile}{\fs24  would be just as effective. 
\par 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 In Role-Playing Situations:}{\fs24  Since the Showman views all new acquaintances as potential audiences, he enjoys meeting people from all walks of life. The Showman is especially fond of members of the opposite sex, and will often go
 to great lengths to impress and dazzle them, sometimes at the expense of the business at hand. Most NPCs see the Showman as endearing and charming, but some find his attention-getting antics obnoxious. 
\par \tab Among his companions, the Showman is appreciated fo
r his pleasant attitude and positive outlook. He is always able to boost morale with a clever trick or entertaining demonstration. At times, PC leaders might have a problem impressing the Showman with the seriousness of a situation or getting him to focus
 on an important task, but flattery or indulgence usually get the Showman's cooperation
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Changing Personality Types
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab Players are encouraged to alter the above personality types in any way they see fit. Characteristics of one personality can be combined wit
h characteristics of another to create brand new types (Brooding Commanders are possible, as are Obsessive Mystery Men). The DM is also free to modify the personality types and make suggestions to his players. As always, the DM has the right to forbid the
 players from choosing extreme personalities for their characters; for instance, the DM might decide that Mercenaries are too disruptive to his campaign and suggest an alternative to his players. 
\par \tab Sometimes, a player might wish to change his character's pe
rsonality. Maybe the character has matured and outgrown his old personality type. Or maybe the character has reached a turning point in his life that has forced him to change his outlook or rethink his philosophy. 
\par \tab Since the personality types are not gove
rned by a strict set of rules, players can change them whenever appropriate. However, such changes should be rare, and typically should mark a major turning point in his life; a player should not change his character's personality just for the sake of try
i
ng something new. A personality change should develop naturally out of the events of the campaign, perhaps as a result of a catastrophic event; for instance, an Altruist might become a Brooder because a friend or family member was brutally murdered by a h
oard of pillaging orcs. 
\par \tab Following are some ways such changes might occur. 
\par \tab The Altruist may become disillusioned when a formerly trusted companion sells him out or when he realizes that his good intentions are unappreciated by the commoners he has vowed 
to defend. This Altruist might then become a Brooder. If his altruism turns to cynicism, he might decide to become a Mercenary. 
\par \tab The Brooder may experience an enlightening event that gives him a more positive attitude; for instance, he could earn the admi
ration of a child or he could fall in love. Since he is sensitive and introspective by nature, a former Brooder could become a Counselor. 
\par \tab The Commander could become fed up with the constant responsibility for the others in his party, or the burden of com
mand could begin to overwhelm him. Depending on his disposition, he could become a Brooder, a Counselor, an Altruist, or even an Intimidator. Regardless of his change (unless he is consumed with bitterness or completely amoral) he'll still have leadership
 tendencies and likely will find the urge to give orders impossible to resist. 
\par \tab The Counselor isn't likely to change, since his personality type is associated with maturity and experience. He could temporarily become a Commander if no one else was availabl
e, but most other personalities are so contrary to his nature that he would find it difficult to change himself. 
\par \tab The Intimidator is not likely to change much, either. Possibly, falling in love or experiencing some other dramatically positive experience c
ould soften him enough to make him consider changing his outlook. In time, a reformed Intimidator could become a Counselor, or he could eventually assume the duties of a Commander. 
\par \tab The Mercenary could easily become an Obsessive if he becomes consumed wit
h acquiring an impossibly large amount of treasure or locating an artifact that does not exist. Exposure to the world's impoverished and neglected might encourage him to change his ways and become an Altruist.
\par \tab  The Mystery Man could become just about any other personality type (except a Neophyte) once he decides to abandon his veil of secrecy. 
\par \tab The Neophyte will eventually become more mature and lose his youthful naivete. His experiences in the campaign will probably suggest a new personality for him. (No
te that it is extremely unlikely that a character will change from his current personality into a Neophyte; that would probably require the character to lose his memory and become young again.)
\par \tab The Obsessive will not change unless he gives up his obsession, in which case he will likely become a Brooder. If he reaches his goal, he could become nearly any personality type. 
\par \tab The Showman might be forced to assume more responsibility and become a Commander, or he could become disillusioned with constantly tryi
ng to win the approval of others and become a Brooder. If he begins charging money for his performances, he might be tempted to become a Mercenary. A Showman bent on developing the ultimate magical effect might risk becoming an Obsessive.

\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Character Background}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab When a player has selected a personality type for his character, he can individualize him further by ma
king decisions about his appearance, his interests, his family, and other details about his background. This information does not need to be recorded on the character sheet, but the player is certainly allowed to do so. The more a player knows about his c
haracter, the more he will seem like a real person and be more fun to play. Here are just a few of the many details to consider. 
\par 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Name:}{\fs24  Some wizards prefer exotic names that add to their reputations as men of mystery. Such a name is sometimes a modificati
on of the wizard's real name, such as "Brindon" for a wizard whose real name is "Benbrindon Swule. " Alternately, a wizard might make up a new name for himself; for instance, Benbrindon Swule might decide to call himself "Antra," an arcane term meaning "C
hampion of the Dawn. " Many wizards also add an adjective to their names to declare their importance to the world, such as "Brindon the Dark" or "Antra the Magnificent. "\tab  
\par 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Age:}{\fs24  Think about the wizard's age and how it might influence his outlook and attit
udes. Older wizards tend to be wiser and slower, while younger wizards are more energetic and impulsive. Wizards frequently have long careers; human wizards can be active well into their 80s and beyond. However, it is unusual for a novice wizard to be you
nger than 20 or so, since magical training can take many years. 
\par 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Physical Appearance:}{\fs24  What does the wizard look like? How tall is he? How much does he weigh? What color are his hair and eyes? Does he have any interesting birthmarks? Scars? How did he get them?\tab  
\par \tab 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Mannerisms:}{\fs24 
 Often a wizard has a unique physical quirk, eccentric behavior, or habitual expression that sets him apart from the crowd. Does the wizard rub his chin when he's thinking? Does he always sleep on his back? Does he pick his teeth with his fingernail?\tab 
 
\par 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Beliefs:}{\fs24  Is the wizard religious? Is his outlook on life generally positive, or is he a pessimist by nature? Is he superstitious? Does he have any phobias?\tab  
\par 
\par  \tab }{\b\fs24 Birthplace and Nationality:}{\fs24  The wizard's birthplace reflects his cultural heritage, which in turn influences the way he looks at the world. Is he upper class (or the equivalent)? Middle class? Born in poverty?\tab  
\par 
\par  \tab }{\b\fs24 Family:}{\fs24  What were the wizard's parents like? Did they encourage him to be a wizard, or are they ashamed of his avoc
ation? Was the wizard an orphan (and if so, has he learned why he was abandoned)? Does he have brothers and sisters? Is he still close to them? If not, what happened?\tab  
\par 
\par  \tab }{\b\fs24 Birthright:}{\fs24  Does the wizard have a special birthright, such as a family heirloom or a share of the family holdings? Does he stand to inherit this birthright when he reaches a certain age or achieves a certain goal?\tab  
\par 
\par  \tab }{\b\fs24 Education:}{\fs24  Where did the wizard receive his magical training? Did he attend a prestigious academy? Was he taught by a mentor? Several mentors? Is he on good terms with them, or are they estranged? If so, what happened?\tab  
\par 
\par  \tab }{\b\fs24 Career:}{\fs24  Unless the wizard is independently wealthy, depends on the kindness of strangers, or lives like a hermit, he probably has some way to earn a liv
ing. In many cases, a wizard's school of specialization will suggest a career; for instance, a diviner could probably earn a good living as a fortune teller. Otherwise, the character can pick any career or vocation that seems reasonable and doesn't contra
dict his upbringing. (See the following section for suggestions.)\tab  
\par 
\par  \tab }{\b\fs24 Clothing:}{\fs24  You can tell a lot about a person by the way he dresses. A wizard favoring dark robes suggests a conservative personality, while a wizard wearing glittering shirts and multi-co
lored trousers is probably as flamboyant as his clothing. 
\par \tab 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Likes and Dislikes:}{\fs24  Does the wizard have a favorite food? A favorite drink? Does he like music, books, or art? What types? What does he do for fun? Is he a sportsman? A gambler? A collector?

\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Wizardly Careers}{\fs24 
\par 
\par  \tab Owing to their wide range of abilities, the professions available to wizards are almost without limit. Below are a few of the most common careers. Each career includes the names of specialists and kits which are commonly associated with 
it-- but note that these are general guidelines only, and there are likely to be exceptions in many campaigns. 
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Teacher
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab A wizard opting for a career as a teacher could be either an instructor at a magical academy (full-time or part-time), a professor at
 a regular college, or a private tutor. The wizard's background might suggest his academic field; history, mathematics, and any of the sciences are likely possiblities. \tab 
\par \tab Suggested Kits: Academician, Patrician, Wu Jen 
\par \tab Suggested Specialties: Invoker, Abjurer, Transmuter, Enchanter
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Administrator}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab Frequently, the local wizard is one of the most learned men in his geographic area. If he has earned the trust of the citizenry, he may be asked to serve as a government administrator. Wizards are more likely to
 be administrators of small villages than large cities, since the needs of a small village are not likely to be as demanding, leaving the wizard plenty of free time to pursue his research. 
\par \tab Suggested Kits: Academician, Amazon Sorceress, Militant Wizard, Patrician
\par \tab Suggested Specialties: Diviner, Abjurer, Transmuter
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Advisor

\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Trader}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab A wizard's quest for hard-to-find components for his spells and his research can take him to cities and villages around the world. A career as a tradesman 
can be a natural outgrowth of these travels. Wizard traders are most likely to deal in precious gems, potions, and various collector's items. A wizard may also earn a living as a broker in spell components, dealing exclusively with other wizards.

\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Physician}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab Although the healing arts are more typically associated with priests, wizards also have been known to work in the field of
 medicine, thanks to their talents for manufacturing potions of healing and other healthful elixirs. Wealthy noblemen have been known to hire wizards as their personal physicians.

\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Treasure Hunter
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab A wizard who spends his days as a member of an adventuring party has ample opportunity to discover treasures and earn rewards. Exceptionally talented wizards may receive a weekly or monthly retainer from an adv
enturing party in addition to a share of any treasure discovered or rewards earned. Such wizards have no need for formal careers, assuming their services are in demand or the missions they undertake are successful. 
\par \tab Suggested Kits: Amazon Sorceress, Anagakok, Militant Wizard, Savage Wizard
\par \tab Suggested Specialists: Conjurer, Illusionist, Necromancer, Invoker
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Entertainer
\par 
\par }{\fs24 \tab A wizard with a flair for the dramatic can earn a decent-- if irregular-- living as a professional entertainer. Opportunities include pri
vate shows for noblemen, annual celebrations, and street performances after which the wizard passes the hat for donations. Enterprising wizards sometimes rent halls and stage shows, charging admission from entertainment-starved citizens.

\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Lecturer}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab To earn a living as a lecturer, a wizard must have the engaging personality of an entertainter as well as the knowledge of a scholar. Such a wizard may travel from city to city
, giving lectures in his field of expertise at the invitation of academies, royal courts, and private organizations. Lecturers with reputations as compelling speakers sometimes rent halls and charge admission.

\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Author}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab Experienced wizards sometimes record their research procedures, tips for successful spellcasting, or techniques for magical item creation in detailed manuscripts. Depending on the
 reputation of the wizard, such tomes can command hefty sums. Rarely are more than a few copies of any such manuscript produced, but each copy may fetch thousands of gold pieces for the author. Some wizards also have made names for themselves as authors o
f history, mathematics, and philosophy texts. \tab

\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Fortune Teller}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab Diviners can take advantage of their skills by charging for their fortune telling services
. While it is common for kings and other noblemen to retain the services of an astrologer, palm reader, or other type of fortune teller, some wizards set up shop on their own, charging a fee to anyone in need of their talents. Unscrupulous wizards have be
en known to sell their services as fortune tellers to superstitious peasants, even though these wizards may lack any actual ability in this area.

\par \tab Many wizards with a flair for research and laboratory technique become successful alchemists. Most of their work is non-magical in nature, creating fertilizers, perfumes, cough medicines, tooth powders, and food coloring for modest fees. Magic
al potions, while requiring more skill and effort, are also sold, although few commoners can afford such expensive creations.

\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Wizard Adventures}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab 
Occasionally, the DM might wish to slant some of his campaign's adventures toward his wizard player characters. To do so, he needs to devise a way to bring the wizard characters into the adventure without excluding the other player characters. Followin
g are several suggestions that can be used as springboards for this sort of adventure
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 The Novice Wizard}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab A low-level wizard who has just graduated from an academy of magic (or has just ended his apprenticeship with a mentor) is often sent into the world 
to complete a mission or quest. The mission serves as his final exam; its completion proves to the novice's superiors that he has successfully mastered his magical skills and is ready to take his place as a full-fledged wizard. Failure means that the novi
ce requires additional training.
\par \tab  There are all types of suitable missions. For instance, the novice's superiors might ask him to journey into an uncharted jungle to retrieve the blossom of a rare flower. They might ask him to explore the ruins of an ancie
nt castle to search for a long-lost spell book, or travel to a small village and drive off a hoard of invading monsters. Since most mentors encourage their apprentice wizards to seek help (it teaches them the importance of cooperation), the wizard might r
ecruit his player character companions to aid him.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 The Outcast Wizard
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab In many societies, the practice of magic is considered blasphemous. Ordinary citizens shun and despise all wizards, considering them to be disciples of supernatural forces. In extreme 
cases, those suspected of being wizards are imprisoned or even executed.
\par \tab A player character wizard may have been operating secretly in such a society, fearing the worst if his true skills were revealed. The wizard would welcome the chance to join a party 
preparing to embark on any type of adventure, if it were to take him far away from his homeland. Alternately, a party might encounter a wizard who was forced to leave home when his skills were discovered by his countrymen or his family.
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2  
\par Magic's Good Name}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab 
In a world where magic has a bad reputation, a PC wizard might want to join an adventuring party to prove that magic can be used as a force of good. If the party's mission is successful and the wizard is at least partly responsible, magic might once ag
ain be accepted as a respectable and honorable profession. 
\par \tab There are any number of situations incorporating this idea:\tab

\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Assisting the Citizenry}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab Many wizards serve as administ
rators, advisors, or teachers, or hold other positions of responsibility in their communities. The local citizens are likely to barrage such wizards with a constant stream of requests for favors and assistance. Most of these requests will be trivial and e
asily addressed, but others might require the PC wizard to recruit the help of his player character companions. 
\par \tab Sometimes, a seemingly innocuous request ("Something's been into my crops-- I think it's a bunch of kids. Could you stop them?") might lead the
 PC wizard to believe that more is happening than meets the eye. He might summon his companions to help him investigate, and their discoveries could be the beginning of a long campaign. (The party discovers clawed footprints among the damaged crops. The f
ootprints lead to a nearby forest, then abruptly vanish. What's going on?).
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 The Scholarly Quest}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab A wizard player character engaged in magical research might require a particular component that exists only in a hard-to-reach part of the world. If the journ
ey promises to be dangerous, the wizard might ask his friends to accompany him. Alternately, if a PC wizard encounters a party going in the same direction, he might agree to assist them on their mission in exchange for safe passage to the location of his 
s
ought component. After recovering the component, the wizard might have become close enough to the other PCs to voluntarily continue on their mission with them. Or maybe the other PCs got the wizard out of a tough spot and the wizard feels obligated to ret
urn the favor by completing the mission with them. 
\par \tab The party's mission might coincide with something the wizard PC wants. For instance, the party might be embarking on a mission to stop a notorious evil wizard. The evil wizard might possess a magical devi
ce the PC wizard has coveted for a long time. The PC wizard could agree to help the party in exchange for the magical device.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Out of Retirement}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab An elderly wizard might grow weary of his sedentary existence and welcome any opportunity to add some excitem
ent to his life. Such a wizard would eagerly join any party of player characters if the party's mission promised to be exciting and didn't violate the wizard's personal values (a PC wizard of good alignment is unlikely to join an evil party about to embar
k on a murder spree unless he is pretending to be evil in order to stop them). 
\par \tab Since a party can always use an extra wizard, a group of player characters might coax an old PC wizard out of retirement to help them on a mission. The PC wizard might be entic
ed by a monetary reward, the lure of adventure, or the possibility of settling an old debt (perhaps the party believes they will be facing an old nemesis of the PC wizard). The PC wizard also might agree to help them out of a sense of loyalty to his forme
r companions
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Magic in the Campaign World}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab Whether designing a campaign or establishing the parameters of a single adventure, the DM will find it helpful to understand the prevalence of magic in his world. Is magic relatively common-- are wizards encounter
ed as frequently as any other character type-- or is magic extremely rare, with practitioners relegated to rumors and legend?  Deciding how much magic exists involves not just the number of wizards and magical items, but also the prevalence of spells, mag
ical monsters, and magical effects in general. 
\par \tab Here are a few of the questions the DM should consider when deciding how magic fits into his world:\tab  
\par 
\par  \tab }{\b\fs24 How common are wizards?}{\fs24  The frequency with which wizards are encountered gives a good indication of how
 often a party is likely to encounter magical items and spell books. Obviously, if magic is uncommon, magical items are especially valuable. 
\par 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 How available are academies and mentors?}{\fs24  A world with little magic provides would-be wizards with few opportunit
ies to learn their crafts. Advancement through the various levels of skill is likely to be slow. Certain specialties may not be available at all. Conversely, a world where magic is relatively common should have a variety of specialists of all levels among
 its population. 
\par 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 How are wizards accepted among the general population?}{\fs24 
 Are wizards feared or respected? Revered or despised? A predominance of magic does not guarantee that the general population feels comfortable with wizards; though familiarity can foster acceptance, it can also breed prejudice and resentment. 
\par 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Is there a relationship between magic and political power?}{\fs24  Wizards usually wield more power than any other group in a society. Have the wizards used their power for political gain? Are they co
mmonly found as rulers and administrators? Does the general population reject the idea of wizard rulers (wizards are too strange or too frightening) or do they embrace it (wizards are smart and deserve to run the government)?\tab  
\par 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 How integrated are wizards in the rest of society? Do wizards live openly, or must they keep their abilities secret?}{\fs24 
 Are wizards able to walk down the street unmolested, or do they invariably draw a crowd of curious on-lookers or hostile townsmen who regard them as a threat? Do the
y live in a special area of town, or can they make their homes anywhere they wish? Do they associate only with other wizards, do they mingle freely with people from all walks of life, or do they prefer a solitary existence?
\par \tab There are no fixed rules for the amount of magic available in a campaign world, as long as the DM strives for consistency and balance. Following are some general guidelines for several different types of campaigns. 
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Worlds With Excessive Amounts of Magic}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab In worlds where magic is rela
tively common, the non-wizard is sometimes the outsider. Wizards are the most frequently encountered character class and typically hold all positions of power. Wizards of good alignments consider themselves caretakers of the non-wizard population; wizards
 of evil alignments see the non-wizards as an exploitable resource. 
\par \tab Kingdoms controlled by evil wizards often clash with one another. They also frequently wage war on kingdoms controlled by good wizards. The awesome power wielded in these conflicts can ea
sily devastate the entire world. (Think of such conflicts as the wizardly equivalent of nuclear war.)
\par \tab Mentors and academies of magic are common, as are wizards of all schools and levels. Novices tend to rise quickly in ability, and high-level wizards are 
in abundance. Magical items and magical monsters abound. There may be a large number of priests as well, since they are also magic-users, but an abundance of wizards does not guarantee that a world has an abundance of priests. (Priests get their magical a
bilities from the gods, who may be as generous or as stingy with their gifts as the DM wants.)
\par \tab Worlds where magic is prevalent are invariably populated by a large number of powerful characters. The DM will probably have his hands full trying to maintain pl
ay balance, devising challenging adventures for his player characters, and prevent non-wizard player characters from feeling overwhelmed or insignificant. For these reasons, it is suggested that only experienced DMs attempt to stage adventures in a magic-
heavy campaign world. Creating a world where magic is taken for granted can be difficult, but for DMs and players up to the challenge, it can be a fascinating alternative
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Worlds With Typical Amounts of Magic
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab "Typical" in this sense means the amount of magic present within the limits of an average AD&D\'ae
 campaign world. In such worlds, magic is known to exist, but real wizards are regarded with awe and perhaps a little suspicion. Average people may be baffled by magic and others may be afraid of it, but all are impressed by its power. 
\par \tab Wizards are uncommon, especially those of higher levels. Novices wishing to master a particular school of magic may have to work hard to find a suitable mentor or academy. In some areas of the world, certain specialists may n
ot even exist. Spell books, magical items, and magical monsters are relatively rare; finding one will probably be a major event in the life of any character. 
\par \tab To avoid violating the unique nature of magic in this type of world, the DM must be careful to s
et limits on the availability of magical items, spell books, and magical effects in general. He also may wish to limit the number of magic-users by deciding whether PCs can be multi-class or dual class characters with wizard or priest spells. In a campaig
n
 where such restrictions are in force, evil wizards will not need to be quite as powerful to be effective against a typical party. Without such restrictions, there are likely to be more magic-users in a party, meaning that evil wizards will need to be of 
higher levels to be effective opponents.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Worlds With Low Amounts of Magic}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab Not surprisingly, wizards are rare commodities in worlds where little magic exists. Most people have never seen a real wizard. In some of these societies, wizards are confined to m
yths and legend. A player character wizard will likely be restricted to low levels, and advancement will be difficult. In fact, it may be impossible for a wizard to reach higher levels of ability-- such spells may simply not exist. Magical items are extre
mely rare, if they exist at all. Magical monsters are equally rare, but those encountered are especially formidable, wielding powers unheard of by a typical adventuring party.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Worlds With No Magic
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab By means of a portal, a magical device or artifact, or di
vine intervention, an adventuring party might find themselves on a world where magic does not exist. Alternately, a player character may find himself transported from a world where magic is common to a world with no magic. Aside from the PC wizards in the
 
party, such a world has no wizards at all. There are also no magical items, spell books, magical monsters, or magical effects of any kind. Such a world will have a number of interesting ramifications for wizard characters, as well as for the party as a wh
ole.

\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Campaign Variations
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab Following are a few off-beat suggestions for using wizards and magic in a campaign. The DM is free to modify, combine, and vary these suggestions as he sees fit
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 The All-Wizard Campaign
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab In this type of campaign, most of the player characters are wizards. Other classes are allowed, but they are usually restricted to one character from each class. (That is, a party
 can have no more than one warrior, one priest, and one rogue-- the rest are wizards.)
\par \tab To begin this type of campaign, the DM can encourage players to take PC wizards by fostering an atmosphere where NPCs have a special admiration for wizards or where mag
ic is an especially revered field of study. Alternately, the DM can simply require the players to use wizard characters. \tab 
All wizard kits are allowed in this type of campaign, as are multi-class and dual-class characters as long as one of the class choices
 is wizard. The DM is forewarned that he will have to be especially creative to invent adversaries of sufficient power to provide acceptable challenges for a party of wizards.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 The Single Wizard Kit Campaign
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab The DM might decide that all magic in his worl
d stems from a particular culture; therefore, all wizards must have the same kit. This includes player character wizards and well as NPC wizards of all alignments. Among the kits especially appropriate for this type of campaign are the Amazon, the Anagako
k, and the Wu Jen. If the DM wishes, player characters of all classes might be required to take the same kit, but this is not necessary for an interesting campaign. 
\par \tab How this type of campaign affects the existence of magical items and magical monsters is the decision of the DM, but there are likely to be fewer of both (see }{\i\fs24 Worlds With Low Amounts of Magic }{\fs24 
in the Magic in the Campaign World section above). In a campaign where all magic comes from an Amazon culture, all magical items will have their origin in
 that culture. Dragons, for instance, may exist throughout the world, but all of them trace a common ancestry to a land dominated by Amazons.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 The Restricted School Campaign}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab In this type of campaign, certain schools of magic do not exist. For instance, in a world where the school of illusion does not exist, wizards do not have access to }{\i\fs24 phantasmal force, minor creation}{\fs24 
, or any other illusion spells, nor are they allowed to specialize as illusionists. Researching these types of spells is also forbidden. If
 a spell belongs to two schools, then the spell is still available if it belongs to a school that still exists. For instance, in a world where the school of illusion does not exist, }{\i\fs24 rainbow pattern}{\fs24 
 is available since it also belongs to the school of alteration. \tab 
\par \tab Whether magical items that duplicate the effects of non-existent schools are available is the DM's decision, but for consistency, it makes sense to forbid them. Another good idea is to give wizards access to the spells from the school of lesser di
vination-- it is very difficult to function as a wizard without them. 
\par \tab As another variation, the DM might consider having more than one non-existent school in his campaign world. (Schools in direct opposition to one another, as shown in Figure 1 in Chapte
r 2, are good choices to eliminate. For instance, if the school of illusion is nonexistent, then the school of necromancy might not exist either).  In an especially restrictive world, perhaps only one school of magic exists; if only the school of illusion
 exists in the DM's world, then all wizards must be illusionists and have access only to illusion spells-- spells from any other school do not exist.
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 
\par The Restricted Level Campaign
\par 
\par }{\fs24 \tab Similar to the Restricted School Campaign, in this variation, high-level m
agic does not exist. For instance, the DM might decide that no spells of 6th level or higher exist. Therefore, a wizard has access to spells of 1st level through 5th level only, and he is unable to research higher-level spells. As with the Restricted Scho
ol Campaign, the DM decides whether magical devices duplicating the effects of higher-level spells exist. 
\par

\par }{\b\fs32\cf2 Chapter 5: Combat and the Wizard
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab This chapter tells the wizard how to make the most of his magical abilities in combat. It also includes some tips for effective strategy and planning, along with advice on weapon selection.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 The Spell Arsenal
\par }{\fs24 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 The Wizard's Advantages}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab In combat, there are two important advantages a wizard has over the non-magicusing members of his party:\tab 
\par 
\par \tab 1. The wizard is an extremely versatile opponent; high-level wizards are likely to be the most versatile characters in an adventuring party. 
\par 
\par \tab 2. While the abilities of most other characters tend to confine them to specific roles, the wizard can adapt his skills to new situations
 by selecting the appropriate spells from his spell books (assuming that the wizard has access to a variety of spells). For instance, a high-level warrior has the same skills today that he did yesterday. 
\par \tab But a high-level wizard begins each day anew, memo
rizing a selection of spells from his spell books that may be radically different from those he memorized the day before. With the right spells, a wizard can be a master of reconnaissance one day and an engineer of destruction the next. But if a wizard ha
s
 a large selection of spells in his spell books, how does he know which ones will be most helpful on any particular day? Some wizards, of course, will simply load up with their most powerful spells and hope for the best. But a shrewd wizard will look clos
ely at his spells and analyze their primary functions to decide which are the most appropriate to a particular situation. 
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Spell Categories
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab A helpful way for a wizard to analyze his arsenal is by assigning his spells to various categories. The following system uses six categories based on a spell's use in combat situations. The categories include:\tab  
\par 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Defensive 1.}{\fs24  This category of spells provides protection from harm. It includes spells that make the subject more difficult to hit, increase his resistance 
to damage, and shield him from various types of opponents. Usually, a wizard casts this type of spell on himself or on his allies. 
\par 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Defensive 2.}{\fs24  This category of spells hinders an opponent's ability to attack without directly causing damage to the opponent. It includes various }{\i\fs24 charm, hold}{\fs24 
, and blinding spells, along with spells that add penalties to an opponent's attack rolls. Usually, a wizard casts this type of spell directly on one or more of his opponents. 
\par 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Offensive 1.}{\fs24  This category of spells incre
ases the chance to inflict damage on an opponent. It includes spells that give bonuses to attack and damage rolls, as well as those that increase strength. It does not include spells that directly inflict damage. Usually, a wizard casts this type of spell
 on himself or his allies. 
\par 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Offensive 2.}{\fs24  This category of spells directly inflicts damage on opponents. It includes spells that cause an opponent to lose hit points, such as }{\i\fs24 chill touch}{\fs24  and }{\i\fs24 lightning bolt}{\fs24 
, spells that cause creatures to lose levels of ability, such as }{\i\fs24 energy drain}{\fs24 , and spells that cause damage to specific creatures, such as }{\i\fs24 transmute water to dust}{\fs24 
. Usually, a wizard casts this type of spell on one or more of his opponents, although exceptions include spells that create or summon entities to fight on the caster's behalf, such as }{\i\fs24 monster summoning}{\fs24 . \tab  
\par 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Reconnaissance.}{\fs24  This category reveals information about opponents or provides warnings about their actions. 
\par 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Special.}{\fs24  This catch-all category includes spells that have no specific offensive, defensive, or reconnaissance use in combat. 
\par 
\par \tab How do you decide which spells belong to which categories? It is not an exact science, but rather a generalization based on a spell's most common use in combat situations. For instance, }{\i\fs24 fireball}{\fs24  can be used t
o destroy inanimate objects, but in combat situations, it is usually used to inflict damage on an opponent; therefore, it is an Offensive spell -- Offensive 2, to be exact. }{\i\fs24 Light}{\fs24 
 is helpful for finding the way in a dark cavern, but in combat, it can be use
d to blind opponents to reduce their attack rolls, making it a Defensive spell-- more precisely, a Defensive 2 spell. (For quick reference, it may be helpful to note each spell's category next to its name on the character sheet.)
\par \tab If a spell seems to fit i
nto more than one category, that is to be expected. Remember, the point is not to draw rigid boundaries, but to learn to think in terms of a spell's function as opposed to its level or flashy name. As an illustration, here are categorizations of some 1st-
 and 2nd-level spells from the }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook}{\fs24 . \tab  
\par 
\par  \tab }{\b\fs24 Defensive 1:}{\fs24  }{\i\fs24 Protection from evil, armor, shield, mirror image, invisibilty, blur \tab  
\par 
\par }{\fs24  \tab }{\b\fs24 Defensive 2:}{\fs24  }{\i\fs24 Color spray, enlarge, light, grease, shocking grasp, taunt, wall of fog, deafness}{\fs24  \tab  
\par 
\par  \tab }{\b\fs24 Offensive 1:}{\fs24  }{\i\fs24 Spectral hand, strength}{\fs24  
\par 
\par  \tab }{\b\fs24 Offensive 2: }{\i\fs24 Burning hands, shocking grasp, chill touch, flaming sphere, stinking cloud}{\fs24  \tab  
\par 
\par  \tab }{\b\fs24 Reconnaissance:}{\fs24  }{\i\fs24 Alarm, comprehend languages, message, detect undead, ESP \tab  
\par 
\par }{\fs24 \tab }{\b\fs24 Special:}{\fs24  }{\i\fs24 Dancing lights, erase, hold portal, jump, mending, spider climb, wizard mark}{\fs24  
\par 
\par \tab The various categories are discussed in detail in the following sections. Players should use the information to help them assign their spells to categories, which in turn will enable them to choose the best spells for thei
r wizards to memorize in a particular situation

\par \tab Spells in the Defensive 1 category are typically cast on the wizard or on his companions to provide direct protection from attacks; }{\i\fs24 globe of invulnerability, invisibility}{\fs24 , and }{\i\fs24 protection from evil}{\fs24

\par \tab In general, Defensive 2 spells offer more protection than Defensive 1 spells, since they effectively protect the entire party. For instance, a wizard protecting himself with the Defensive 1 }{\i\fs24 globe of invulnerability}{\fs24 
 spell may be safe from an attacking opponent, but the opponent is free to attack the wizard's companions. However, an opponent affected by the Defensive 2 }{\i\fs24 sleep}{\fs24  spell cannot attack anybody in the party. 
\par 
\par \tab Following are some general situations in which a wizard will find Defensive spells particularly useful:\tab  
\par 
\par \tab }{\i\fs24 The party has only a few members or has only low-level members.}{\fs24  The wizard's inability to use armor is his most vulnerable characteristic. A wizard must either count on his companions for protection or provide it for hi
mself. In small parties, there probably are not enough members to provide bodyguards for the wizard. A small party will also have their hands full in combat situations, and probably will not have the time or the resources to look after a wizard. Likewise,
 a party of low-level characters lacking high-quality armor or other protective devices may have to depend on their wizard to provide protection for them. 
\par 
\par \tab }{\i\fs24 The party has taken an excessive amount of damage.}{\fs24  A party that has lost a lot of hit points is not
 in a position to take chances, especially if they anticipate trouble. A wizard armed with Defensive spells can help the party through any tough times ahead. 
\par 
\par  \tab }{\i\fs24 The party includes other player character wizards who lack Defensive spells.}{\fs24  If the party does
 not know what type of dangers it may face, a good idea is to have as many different types of spells available as possible. It is helpful if the wizard arms himself with a healthy supply of Defensive spells if his fellow magic-using companions do not have
 them or choose not to use them. 
\par 
\par  \tab }{\i\fs24 The wizard anticipates being alone.}{\fs24  If the wizard expects to be alone on guard duty or investigating a dangerous locale by himself, operating as a spy, or otherwise functioning without the company of others, he is safest
 with a supply of Defensive spells to compensate for his lack of armor. 
\par 
\par  \tab }{\i\fs24 The party anticipates encountering a specific type of enemy}{\fs24 . Many Defensive spells offer protection against a specific type of attack. If the party believes it will be encountering
 a particular type of opponent, the wizard should arm himself accordingly. (For instance, if the party anticipates encountering an evil wizard, Defensive spells such as }{\i\fs24 dispel magic}{\fs24  and }{\i\fs24 Serten's spell immunity}{\fs24 
 would be wise choices.)

\par \tab Spells in the Offensive 2 category are typically cast on one or more opponents to inflict damage directly, effectively functioning as weapons for the wizard; }{\i\fs24 flaming sphere, shocking grasp}{\fs24 , and }{\i\fs24 finger of death}{\fs24 
 are examples of Offensive 2 spells. 
\par \tab In general, Offensive 2 spells are more effective than Offensive 1 spells, since they inflict damage directly. For instance, a wizard successfully casting an Offensive 1 strength spell on himself must still strike an opponent to inflict
 damage; a successfully cast}{\i\fs24  fireball}{\fs24  inflicts damage immediately. Following are some general situations in which a wizard will find Offensive spells particularly useful:
\par 
\par \tab }{\i\fs24 The party is large or has a number of high-level members.}{\fs24  Again, the main considera
tion is the vulnerability of the armor-less wizard. In larger parties, there are likely to be enough members to supply the wizard with a bodyguard or two (note that this does not mean a bodyguard in the literal sense, but rather a designated member to hel
p
 protect the wizard from attacks). Likewise, if the party has several high-level members with a lot of hit points and high-quality armor, they will not be as dependent on the wizard for protective spells. A wizard who does not need a lot of Defensive spel
ls is free to arm himself with a high number of Offensive spells. 
\par 
\par  \tab }{\i\fs24 The party has few warriors.}{\fs24  While unusual, it is not impossible for a party to be completely composed of wizards, priests, and rogues. In such a case, a wizard with an arsenal of Offensiv
e spells can make an acceptable substitute for a warrior. But note that even the best-armed wizard must still contend with a low Armor Class, meaning he will still need to rely on one or more of his companions for protection. 
\par 
\par  \tab }{\i\fs24 The party is making its last stand.}{\fs24 
 When a party is facing its final challenge at the climax of an adventure (presuming the party realizes they have reached the climax of an adventure) or is making a life-and-death stand against an opponent of awesome power, they may need all of th
e offensive capabilities they can muster. If the wizard genuinely feels he has nothing to lose (or if the wizard is willing to sacrifice his life to achieve the party's goals), he may wish to arm himself with as many Offensive spells as possible to maximi
ze his party's chance of success. 
\par 
\par  \tab }{\i\fs24 The party anticipates facing an onslaught of enemies}{\fs24 . A party may also need heavy offensive capabilities if they anticipate facing a large number of enemies (such as a battlefield filled with hundreds of orcs and goblin
s) or a few enemies with a lot of power (such as a cadre of giants). Again, unless the wizard is willing to lay down his life for the cause, the party should take the wizard's vulnerability into account when planning their strategy. 
\par 
\par  \tab }{\i\fs24 The party includes other player character wizards who lack Offensive spells.}{\fs24 
 This principle applies to the use of Offensive spells as well as Defensive spells. If the first wizard in a party has nothing but Defensive spells, and the second wizard has a variety of both Offens
ive and Defensive spells, it makes sense for the second wizard to arm himself with Offensive spells (unless one of the situations described above suggests a different strategy).

\par  
\par \tab }{\i\fs24 The party is entering an unknown area.}{\fs24  The more a party kno
ws about the potential dangers of a previously unexplored castle, jungle, or stretch of enemy-occupied terrain, the better they can cope with whatever they meet. A quick survey of the territory by a wizard using }{\i\fs24 clairvoyance, detect evil, }{
\fs24 or similar spells can be an effective deterrent against ambushes and other unexpected surprises. 
\par 
\par \tab }{\i\fs24 The party is unsure of the enemy's motivations.}{\fs24  Not all NPCs are enemies (maybe they are hostile because they assume the PCs are the bad guys), and not all enemies are bent 
on destroying the party (maybe they are trying to get back to their leader as quickly as possible and the PCs are in their way). A wizard using }{\i\fs24 ESP, know alignment,}{\fs24 
 or similar spells can clarify the motives of NPCs, possibly allowing the party to avoid combat entirely. 
\par 
\par \tab }{\i\fs24 The party needs a lookout or a volunteer for guard duty.}{\fs24  A wizard armed with spells such as }{\i\fs24 clairaudience, clairvoyance, foresight,}{\fs24  and }{\i\fs24 wizard eye}{\fs24 
 makes an excellent lookout. He can also serve as a party's communications officer in combat, keeping track of his companion's actions, tracking the actions of the enemy, and becoming alerted to companions in need of assistance. 
\par 
\par \tab }{\i\fs24 The party needs a spy.}{\fs24  The wizard who knows a variety of Reconnaissance spells makes a perfect spy, either acting by 
himself (in which case he should ensure that his chances of being discovered are small, since he has no armor) or in conjunction with a companion who can serve as his bodyguard. Unlike rogues or invisible characters, who are also good candidates for spyin
g missions, a wizard using }{\i\fs24 clairaudience, ESP,}{\fs24  and similar spells can gain a lot of information from relatively safe distances.
\par

\par \tab Though nearly all schools have their share of Special spells, the school of illusion has a surplus of them, which is one reason why the illusionist is considered by many to be the least useful specialist in combat. 
\par \tab This does not mean that Special spells are completely useless on the battlefield. As with all types of magic, clever wizards will invariably find a variety of uses for Special spells. For instance, the Special spell }{\i\fs24 dancing lights}{\fs24 
 does not cause blindness or inflict damage, but cast at the right time, it could be used to distract an opponent, rendering him momentarily unable to attack. In general, however, Special spells are the worst choices for a wizard anticipating combat. 

\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 A Mix of Spells
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab In the examples above, we suggested a
 number of situations where it is to the wizard's best advantage to arm himself with an arsenal of spells from a particular category. In some situations, however, a wizard might be better arming himself with a few spells from each category. Here are a few
 examples:
\par 
\par \tab }{\i\fs24 The party is beginning a new adventure}{\fs24 
. When embarking on a new adventure or a new episode of an ongoing campaign, it is unlikely that the party will know exactly what obstacles or dangers they will face. In these cases, a wizard armed with a m
ix of Defensive, Offensive, Reconnaissance, and Special spells will be able to handle a variety of situations. As the adventure progresses and the party accumulates more information, the wizard can adjust his spell mix accordingly, perhaps concentrating o
n Defensive or Reconnaissance spells as the situation dictates. 
\par 
\par \tab }{\i\fs24 The party has only a single wizard.}{\fs24  In this case, the party might have to rely on the wizard to assume a variety of roles-- for instance, he may be expected to provide magical protection for
 the party (requiring Defensive spells) as well as ferreting out information about its opponents (requiring Reconnaissance spells). Of course, the more duties a wizard assumes, the less effective he can be at any one of them, but sometimes such a situatio
n
 is unavoidable. The party has a large number of powerful characters in a variety of classes. The more power a party has at its disposal, and the more that power is dispersed among a large number of characters, the less dependent they will be on any one p
a
rty member. In this case, a wizard's arsenal of spells is not as crucial. If the party has a number of strong warriors for offensive and defensive actions (as well as an extra warrior or two to serve as bodyguards for the wizard), has some rogues for spie
s, and has a magical scrying device, it is not vital for a wizard to concentrate exclusively on Defensive, Offensive, or Reconnaissance spells. 
\par 
\par \tab }{\i\fs24 The wizard has no choice.}{\fs24  If the wizard is just beginning his career, he probably does not have a lot of spell
s in his spell books. Likewise, if he has only Defensive spells in his spell book, he obviously cannot choose from the various categories.
\par 
\par  }{\b\fs24\cf2 Weapon Restriction}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab Wizards are severely limited in the weapons they can use. Little if any of their formal traini
ng is devoted to combat, and they usually are unable to devote the time and effort necessary to master such skills. Consequently, their weapon choices are confined to those that are easy to learn and simple to use. As a general rule, the DM should confine
 wizards to the following weapons:
\par Blowgun
\par \tab Barbed dart
\par \tab Needle
\par Dagger or dirk
\par Dart
\par Knife
\par Quarterstaff
\par Sling
\par \tab Sling bullet
\par \tab Sling stone
\par Staff sling
\par 
\par \tab These restrictions apply to magical weapons of similar types as well. For instance, just as a wizard is denied the use of a two-handed sword, he is denied the use of a }{\i\fs24 two-handed sword +1}{\fs24 . 
\par \tab In certain situations, the DM may allow a wizard to use a weapon other than those listed above. However, the DM is cautioned to make exceptions to the wizard's weapon restr
ictions with care, to avoid unbalancing the game and violating the special nature of the wizard. 
\par \tab Here are a few situations where the DM might consider making exceptions to the wizard's weapon restrictions:
\par  
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 The wizard's kit allows for different weapons.}{\fs24 
 The Anagakok kit, for instance, allows for tridents and harpoons, while the Amazon kit allows for spears and long bows. If the DM gives permission for players to pick one of these kits, or another kit with weapons other than those listed above, he should
 also allow him to use the kit's weapons. However, the DM is within his rights to forbid the use of any weapon-- if he decides harpoons are unavailable in his campaign world, then even an Anagakok cannot use them. 
\par 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Instruction in the use of a particular weapon was part of the wizard's training.}{\fs24 
 Just as certain kits allow certain weapons, certain cultures might require all of its citizens to master certain weapons. A warlike culture, for instance, might insist that all of its male citizens are to be traine
d in the use of swords and spears, and wizards are not excluded. The player must establish these type of background details at the beginning of his character's career -- they cannot suddenly be brought into play in the middle of a campaign ("Did I forget 
to mention that my character's father trained him to use a club?"). As always, the DM can veto any background suggestions that he considers unacceptable in his campaign. 
\par }{\b\fs32\cf2 
\par Chapter 6: Casting Spells In Unusual Conditions
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab A wizard's adventures can take him 
to all kinds of exotic locations. But if he finds himself battling foes beneath the ocean's surface or exploring a mysterious locale in an alternate plane of existence, he will discover that his spells are operating a little differently than usual. This c
hapter explains the differences. 
\par \tab Spell casting abilities can also be affected by sensory changes, such as a temporary loss of vision, an impaired ability to speak, and impaired movement. These problems, as well as how a wizard's spells are affected when c
ast under less than optimum conditions and how he might compensate for these differences, will be discussed in this chapter.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Casting Spells Underwater

\par \tab Assuming that the wizard can find a way to breathe underwater for extended periods (such as a }{\i\fs24 water breathing}{\fs24 
 spell or potion), most of his spells will function normally underwater, with identical casting times, ranges, components, and effects. There are, however, a number of exceptions, detailed below. Rather than being frustrated by these changes, the wi

\ls1\adjustright {\fs24 The effects of time occur 10 times slower than on the Prime Material plane. For instance, for every 10 turns that pass on the Ethereal planes, only a sing

\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Conjuration/Summoning:}{\fs24  Non-native beings cannot be summ

 below for details). 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Divination:}{\fs24  Spells that detect or identify mainly respond to the alignment of the plane, overwhelming the alignment of any beings in the plane. For instance, if a good warrior is in the Nine Hells, }{\i\fs24 know alignment}{\fs24 
 is overwhelmed by the plane's evil nature and will not reveal that the warrior is good. However, a detect good will reveal the warrior's goodness. 
\par }{\b\fs24 \tab Illusion/Phantasm:}{\fs24  These spells function normally, though the caster should keep in mind that many of the powerful beings inhabiting these planes are immune to illusionary attacks and effects. However, spells that rely on }{\i\fs24

 that inflict half the standard damage when attacking; shadow magic inflicts only half damage and effects. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Invocation/Evocation:}{\fs24  These function normally, although they may be changed due to prevailing conditions in a particular plane. Generally, these changes are similar to those experienced in the inner planes. For instance, a }{
\i\fs24 wall of ice}{\fs24  will begin to melt immediately in the heat of the Nine Hells. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Necromancy:}{\fs24  These spells have no effect on the natives of the planes. }{\i\fs24 Reincarnation}{\fs24  causes revived indiv
iduals to be of the same alignment as the plane; for instance, a PC reincarnated in the Nine Hells will be evil. Spells that involve a body uninhabited by a spirit, such as magic jar, have a 1 percent chance per day per depth of layer of being inhabited b
y
 native spirits. For instance, a character who died on the eighth layer of the Nine Hells has an 8 percent chance per day of his body being occupied unless it is raised, while a body on the 100th level of the Abyss has a 100 percent chance of being occupi
ed on the first day). The spirits will not voluntarily release the body (a}{\i\fs24  limited wish}{\fs24  or spells of similar power will dispel them). 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Magical Items:}{\fs24  Weapons are reduced by one plus for each plane they are taken through; this applies only when moving from 
plane to plane, not when moving through planar layers. If a weapon becomes non-magical, all special abilities are lost. These penalties do not apply to weapons designed to affect particular creatures of the outer planes. Armor and other protective devices
 
are similarly affected. All other magical items suffer the same limitations as the spells they mimic. Magical items that reach into extradimensional space function normally, but those that draw power from the inner planes or access the Ethereal planes do 
not function.

\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Casting Spells When the Caster is Impaired
\par }{\fs24 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Impaired Vision}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab A wizard's vision can be permanently or temporarily impaired as a result of blindness (magical or natural), disease, poison, or physical damage. Vision is also impaired in darkness. 
\par \tab The ability to see is not crucial in the casting of many spells. For instance, }{\i\fs24 mirror image, monster summoning,}{\fs24  }{\i\fs24 tongues,}{\fs24  and }{\i\fs24 comprehend languages}{\fs24 
 (when used to translate spoken words) do not require the wizard to be looking at anything in particular, and can therefore be cast with impaired vision. However, spells such as }{\i\fs24 read magic, detect invisibility}{\fs24 , and }{\i\fs24 
comprehend languages}{\fs24  (when used to translate written words) that require the wizard to be looking at a particular object or location cannot be cast with impaired vision. 
\par \tab Impaired vision has no effect on spells the wizard casts on himself, such as }{\i\fs24 change self}{\fs24  or }{\i\fs24 armor}{\fs24 . Likewise, impaired vision has no effect when the wizard is attempting a touch spell (such as }{\i\fs24 
protection from evil}{\fs24 ) on a willing subje
ct, presuming the wizard is close enough to the subject to touch him. However, if a wizard attempts to use a touch spell on an unwilling subject, the wizard must make a successful attack roll with a -4 penalty (this assumes that the wizard is close enough
 to his intended subject to touch him). As with all attacks, the DM can modify this roll if the victim is unprepared for the attack or is unaware of it. If the roll succeeds, the wizard touches the subject and the normal spell effect occurs. 
\par \tab Spells that are cast on a specific person, place, or thing from a distance, such as }{\i\fs24 charm person}{\fs24  or }{\i\fs24 magic missile}{\fs24 , cannot be cast by wizards with impaired vision. A wizard cannot simply blast a }{\i\fs24 
magic missile}{\fs24  in a general direction and hope for the best-- the spell does not operate that way. Knowing the exact destination of these types of spells is a vital element of their execution. 
\par \tab Spells that are cast over a general area can be cast by wizards with impaired vision, although their effects may not be as precise as they would be if the wizard could see. For instance, a wizard with impaired vision could cast }{\i\fs24 
flaming sphere }{\fs24 in front of himself and direct it to move straight ahead toward an area where he hears a group of screeching goblins. But if the goblins scatter at the approach of the }{\i\fs24 flaming sphere}{\fs24 
, the wizard will not be able to accurately direct its movement to run them down. 
\par \tab This limitation also holds true for illusion spells that create illusionary images, such as }{\i\fs24 phantasmal force}{\fs24 ; at best, the illusionist is ma
king a rough estimate as to the location of his illusion, and any adjustments he makes to the illusion (such as moving it or having it respond to the actions of other characters) is unlikely to be more than an educated guess. 
\par \tab Additionally, the vision-imp
aired wizard is creating visual illusions from memory, and the results might not always be as precise as they would be if the wizard could see. In general, the more complex the illusion cast by a vision-impaired wizard, the more easily the illusion will b
e disbelieved by an opponent; the DM is free to add as much as a +4 bonus to the saving throws of opponents attempting to disbelieve such illusions (see pages 81-82 of the }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook}{\fs24 
 for details on adjudicating illusions, and the section on illusions in Chapter 7 of this book). \tab 
\par \tab Vision-impaired wizards can use their familiars for information about their surroundings, thus enabling them to cast spells with more accuracy and precision. }{\i\fs24 Wizard eye}{\fs24  and similar spells can help a vision-impaired wizard to "see." 
}{\i\fs24 Infravision}{\fs24  is not always useful in these situations, since it works to enhance the wizard's natural vision (although }{\i\fs24 infravision}{\fs24 
 helps if the wizard's vision is impaired because of darkness, and not because of disease or damage). The non-weapon proficiency Blind Fighting is equally ineffective for the vision-impaired wizard.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Impaired Hearing}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab A wizard's hearing can be permanently or temporarily impaired as a result of deafness (magical or natural), disease, poison, or physical damage (such as rep
eated exposure to loud noises). Unlike the vision-impaired wizard, the hearing-impaired wizard has only modest limitations on his spell casting abilities. 
\par \tab Although most spells have a verbal component, it is not necessary for the wizard to clearly hear th
e words or sounds he utters to cast a spell. These sounds serve to release magical energies which in turn trigger specific reactions; as long as the wizard utters the correct sequence of sounds, it makes no difference if he actually hears the sounds himse
lf. Note that a }{\i\fs24 silence}{\fs24  spell prevents the casting of any spells with verbal components, since }{\i\fs24 silence}{\fs24  prevents the sounds uttered by the wizard. 
\par \tab Spells that require the wizard to hear, such as}{\i\fs24  comprehend languages}{\fs24  (when used to translate speech), are ineffective for hearing-impaired wizards. Spells that create sounds, such as }{\i\fs24 alarm}{\fs24 
, are able to be cast, but the impaired wizard will not hear the effects. 
\par \tab Hearing-impaired wizards casting illusions with audible elements may encounter the same problems as v
ision-impaired wizards. The audible elements of such illusions will have to be educated guesses, based on the wizard's memory of actual sounds. As with illusions cast by sight-impaired wizards, the more complex the illusion cast by a hearing-impaired wiza
r
d, the more easily the audible element of the illusion will be disbelieved by an opponent. The DM is free to add as much as a +4 bonus to the saving throws of opponents attempting to disbelieve such illusions. A hearing-impaired wizard cannot use his fami
liar to serve as surrogate "ears" to enable him to cast such spells with more precision or accuracy
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Impaired Speech
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab A wizard's ability to speak can be impaired as a result of disease, magic (such as a }{\i\fs24 silence}{\fs24  spell), or physical damage. A gagged wizard w
ill also be unable to speak. No spell with a verbal component can be cast by a wizard with impaired speech; he must be able to enunciate each phrase or sound of a spell's verbal component clearly and distinctly for the spell to be successful. }{\i\fs24 
Ventriloquism }{\fs24 cannot substitute for an impaired-speech wizard's voice when he attempts to speak a spell's verbal component; }{\i\fs24 ventriloquism}{\fs24 
 is useless to a speech-impaired wizard, since it is an extension of sounds the wizard is normally able to make. 
\par \tab Similarly, an impaired-speech wizard cannot use his familiar to speak verbal components, including those familiars capable of speech, since spells only operate if the wizard himself utters their verbal components. 
\par \tab However, an impaired-speech wizard can use the spell }{\i\fs24 vocalize}{\fs24  to allow him to cast spells that normally require a verbal component. Casting these spells must take place within the duration of the }{\i\fs24 vocalize }{\fs24 
spell. (For more about vocalize, see Chapter 9. ) According to the }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook}{\fs24  (pages 85-86), the use 
of components is an optional rule. If components aren't used for spell casting in your campaign, it is assumed that the caster must be able to speak in order to cast any spell (see the first paragraph in the Casting Spells section on page 85 of the }{
\i\fs24 PH }{\fs24 ).}{\i\fs24  Vocalize}{\fs24  can still help a speech-impaired wizard if the components rules are not in use; otherwise, all of the rules for speech-impaired wizards apply. 
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Impaired Movement
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab Many spells require somatic components (gestures or movements). If the wizard is un
able to move his hands (because of damage, a magical effect, or physical restraint) he may be unable to cast a spell that requires hand movements. If a spell specifically requires hand movements, the wizard isn't allowed to substitute another method. He c
a
nnot just wiggle his ears or rock his head in place of the required hand movements, nor can he use a familiar or other character (or animated object) to act as his surrogate to execute them. If a single finger is the requirement for a somatic component (f
or instance, if the wizard needs to point at the target of his spell), then he needs only one free hand to cast the spell; otherwise, either hand (or any finger) will suffice. 
\par \tab Note that a movement-impaired wizard also might have difficulty with spells req
uiring material components. If the wizard has his hands tied, he may not be able to reach the necessary material components inside his back pack or mingled with other items in a deep pocket in his robe. Even if he manages to fish them out, certain spells 
may require him to manipulate the material components in a certain way (he might be required to rub the components together or hold them flat in his hand; }{\i\fs24 protection from evil}{\fs24 
 requires the caster to trace a three-foot-diameter circle on the ground with powd
ered silver). If he cannot manipulate the material components as required, the spell will not work. When a wizard acquires a new spell, the DM should clarify its casting procedures. \tab 
\par \tab Remember that the use of components is an optional rule. If components are not used for spell casting in your campaign, assume that the caster must have both arms free in order to cast any spell (see the Casting Spells section on page 85 of the }{
\i\fs24 PH }{\fs24 ). Any combination of hand movements and gestures will suffice. 
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Impaired Concentration}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab The successful casting of a spell requires intense, uninterrupted concentration from the caster. If the caster's concentration is interrupted by an attack, a sudden noise, or any other distraction, the spell is lost. 
\par \tab In certain situations, th
e caster may have trouble focusing or sustaining his concentration. He may be suffering from an extreme headache or other illness. He may be dizzy, fatigued, or otherwise disoriented. Or he may have had a little too much wine and is feeling the after-effe
c
ts. In such cases, the DM can rule that the wizard is unable to cast spells as effectively as he normally would. In extreme cases-- for instance, if the wizard's headache is so severe that he is unable to stand or open his eyes-- the DM might rule that th
e wizard is completely unable to cast spells until his condition improves. 
\par \tab In less extreme cases, the DM can require the wizard to make a successful Intelligence Check before attempting to cast any spell to see if he can muster the necessary degree of con
centration. After the wizard announces which spell he will attempt to cast, the player rolls 1d20.  If the result is less than or equal to the wizard's Intelligence, the spell is cast normally. If the result is greater than the wizard's Intelligence, the 
spell is lost. 
\par \tab The DM might wish to add a penalty or bonus to these Intelligence Checks. For instance, if the wizard is disoriented as a result of falling out of a tree and landing on his head, the DM might require a -2 modifier to his Intelligence Checks
 prior to casting his spells.

\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab The }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook}{\fs24  lists experience levels and spell progressions only for wizards up to 20th level, but there is no rule that specifically restricts wiz
ards from advancing to 21st level and beyond. There are, however, practical reasons for restricting advancement into unusually high levels. Not only is it difficult for the DM to design meaningful challenges for these characters, players quickly become bo
red with characters whose powers and abilities rival those of the gods. A good policy is to enforce mandatory retirement of characters once they reach 20th level; pages 20-21 of the }{\i\fs24 Dungeon Master's Guide}{\fs24  explain how this is done. 

\par \tab Ambitious DMs and curiou
s players are free to explore the campaign possibilities of the upper levels if they so desire. Table 12 gives the experience point requirements and Hit Dice for wizards of levels 21 through 32 (this table is an extension of Table 20 on page 30 of the }{
\i\fs24 Player's Handbook}{\fs24 
). A wizard must earn 365,000 experience points per level to achieve each level beyond 32. After 10th level, wizards earn 1 hit point per level, and they no longer gain additional hit point bonuses for high Constitution scores. 
\par \tab Table 13 gives the spell progression for wizards of levels 21 through 32 (this table is an extension of Table 21 of the }{\i\fs24 PH }{\fs24 
). For 33rd level, add one each 5th-, 6th-, and 7th-level spell; for 34th level, add one each 1st-, 2nd-, 3rd-, and 4th-level spell; for 35th level, add one each 8th- and 9th-level spell; and for levels beyond 36th, repeat this progression.

\par \tab In a high-level campaign, the DM m
ight decide that his characters do not have access to an adequate number of high-level spells. Rather than fuss with 10th-level spells, the DM is encouraged to add to the list of 9th-level spells (see the section on Spells in Chapter 2 for suggestions)

 character to also be entirely }{\i\fs24 invisible}{\fs24 . The DM might assume, for instance, that the illusion extends to a 1-foot or 
2-foot radius around the affected subject; hence, all objects in contact with the subject that are within this area are also }{\i\fs24 invisible}{\fs24

\par \tab One of the most frequently overlooked functions of }{\i\fs24 Melf's minute meteors}{\fs24  (or any flame-producing spell, such as}{\i\fs24  fireball}{\fs24

\par 
\par }{\b\fs24 Tongues}{\fs24  
\par \tab This spell can be quite useful to the wizard for discreetly communicating with other characters, but only if he understands exactly how it works. }{\i\fs24 Tongues}{\fs24 
 acts as a selective translator, not as a universal translator-- that is, not everyone in the spell's area of effect understands the translated language. 
\par \tab For instance, imagine that a wizard can speak only common. All other 
members of his party also speak only common. The party encounters a group of two dwarves and one gnome; the dwarves speak only dwarvish, the gnome speaks only gnomish. The wizard casts }{\i\fs24 tongues}{\fs24 
 and speaks to the gnome; the gnome automatically understands wh
at the wizard says, but the dwarves and the other party members do not--as far as they can tell, the wizard is speaking gnomish. Assuming the wizard is of sufficiently high level (he can speak one additional tongue for every three levels of experience) an
d the spell's duration has not yet expired, he can also address the dwarves. Both dwarves will understand the wizard, but the gnome and the rest of the party will not. 
\par \tab If a dwarf and a gnome begin chattering at the wizard at the same time, and the wizard 
is of sufficiently high level and the spell's duration hasn't expired, the wizard can understand them both. The other party members, however, will hear nothing but babble

\par }{\b\fs24 Dig}{\fs24  
\par \tab This is a very helpful spell when dealing with large, uncontrollable fires that are spreading in a field or other open area. To stop the advance of a spreading fire, }{\i\fs24 dig}{\fs24 
 can be used to create a firebreak--a ditch of broken soil devoid of combustible material. A fire reaching a firebreak will stop advancing, eventually b
urning itself out. If the fire is too large to stop, the wizard can protect himself and his companions by using }{\i\fs24 dig}{\fs24 
 to surround themselves with a firebreak and remain inside it while the fire rages around them. The wizard must take care to make the firebre
ak large enough to protect himself and his companions from heat damage, which typically affects those within 5 feet of the flames.

\par }{\b\fs24 Fumble}{\fs24  
\par \tab This spell can cause a lot of grief to opponents in precarious positions. }{\i\fs24 Fumble}{\fs24  cast on a character clinging to t
he side of a cliff might cause him to fall. If cast on a character moving hand over hand across a rope bridge, the character might lose his grip and fall. If such a character fails his saving throw, he plunges from the cliff or releases the rope. If he su

\par \tab The DM is responsible for determining the components, duration, casting time, and area of effect each time a }{\i\fs24 wish}{\fs24  is to be cast. The DM should first determine what effect the wizard intends to achieve with his }{\i\fs24 wish}{\fs24 
, then decide the components, casting time, and so forth, basing his decisions on his limitations for }{\i\fs24 wishes}{\fs24  in his campaign. The elements should be logical and reasonable. Here are some guidelines: 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Components:}{\fs24  }{\i\fs24 Wishes}{\fs24  have only verbal components. Keep them simple. A short, spoken phrase is usually sufficient. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Duration:}{\fs24  In most cases, the effects of a }{\i\fs24 wish}{\fs24  will be permanent. The DM should decide in advance if there are any exceptions. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Casting Time:}{\fs24  If the }{\i\fs24 wish}{\fs24  mimics the function of another spell, use that spell's casting time as a guideline, perhaps making it a little longer if the
 wish effect is significantly more powerful than the mimicked spell. For instance, if a }{\i\fs24 wish}{\fs24  is used to }{\i\fs24 teleport}{\fs24  a party (as described above), note that the }{\i\fs24 teleport without error}{\fs24 
 spell has a casting time of 1. Since the }{\i\fs24 wish}{\fs24  has a more powerful effect, a casting time of 4 or 5 for a teleporting }{\i\fs24 wish}{\fs24 
 is appropriate. When in doubt, use the casting times for other 9th-level spells as guidelines, or use a casting time of 1 round.
\par  \tab }{\b\fs24 Area of Effect:}{\fs24  In most cases, common sense will determine the area of effect. For instance, if a }{\i\fs24 wish}{\fs24 
 is to be used to heal damage, the affected persons should be within sight of the caster. The DM can be reasonably generous with areas of effect. If the caster }{\i\fs24 wishes}{\fs24  for 5,000 gp to be deposited in a chest 1,000 miles away, that is 
within reason. As an example of how all of these elements might be determined, imagine that the wizard }{\i\fs24 wishes}{\fs24  to }{\i\fs24 teleport}{\fs24 
 himself and his party to the wizard's home town. The DM determines the elements of the spell as follows: 
\par \tab Verbal Component: Speak the name of the desired location. 
\par \tab Duration: Instantaneous. 
\par \tab Casting Time: 1 round. 
\par \tab Area of Effect: All characters within a 20-yard radius of the caster.

\par 
\par \tab Whether an NPC is able to disbelieve a PC wizard's illusion or
 whether a PC is able to disbelieve an NPC illusion is ultimately up to the DM. The DM should allow a saving throw against an illusion if the subject has any reason at all to doubt the existence of what he is experiencing. To account for the degree of rea
lism in a given illusion, as well as any information available to the subject about the perceived illusion, the DM should modify the subject's saving throws with appropriate bonuses and penalties.

factors that can be considered to help determine bonuses and penalties for saving throws. It's unrealistic to expect the DM to meticulously evaluate every aspect of an illusion before he decides on the modifiers, but the following can be used as general g
uidelines
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 
\par Complexity--Non-Living Objects}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab The most important element in determining an illusion's believability is its complexity. The more complex the illusion, the more difficult it is for the caster to get all the details right, and the more likely it 
is for a subject to notice a mistake. There are more details to a fire-breathing dragon than there are to a stationary boulder, so it is no surprise that a subject would be more likely to disbelieve the illusionary dragon than he would the illusionary roc
k. 
\par \tab An illusion can be a re-creation of a non-living (inanimate) or a living (animate) object. These need to be treated in different ways. 
\par \tab In general, the complexity of non-living objects depends on size (a pebble vs. a boulder), number (a single boulder
 vs. a dozen boulders scattered over an area), and appearance (a smooth gray boulder vs. a sparkling, multi-colored gem). External forces affecting the object also affect its complexity (wind blowing pebbles along the ground or an avalanche of boulders tu
mbling down a hill). 
\par \tab If the illusion has an excessive number of sensory elements, the subject's saving throw may receive a positive modifier. What constitutes an excessive number of elements? A single color or texture (for instance, a smooth gray boulder)
 is not excessive.  Multiple colors and textures (a pile of various types of gems or minerals) or several different sensory elements (a field of variously colored flowers that have a variety of fragrances) could be considered excessive, as could the illus
ion of motion, such as boulders tumbling down a hill. 
\par \tab These factors are not necessarily cumulative; in fact, only in the most exceptional cases would an illusion of non-living objects result in a saving throw modifier of more than +2. 
\par \tab Examples:

 is likely to arouse suspicion.

\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Complexity--Living Objects
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab Generally, the higher the Hit Dice or level of the illusionary creature, the more complex it is to convincingly create and the more likely it is for a subject to disbelieve. An illusion of an an
t is easier to create than the illusion of a dragon. This also applies to illusionary NPCs--a 15th-level warrior is harder to create than a peasant with 3 hit points. Similarly, the more creatures included in the illusion, the harder it is to create; an i
llusion of 20 peasants would be more difficult than a single peasant. 
\par \tab Illusions of active creatures are more difficult to create than illusions of relatively inactive creatures. If the illusionary creature is executing a simple action, such as standing st
ill, polishing its sword, or grazing in the grass, no special modifier for the subject's saving throw may be required. However, if the illusionary creature is executing a complex series of actions, such as singing a song while dancing and juggling, or att
acking with two weapons while shouting a war cry, a modifier may be in order. 
\par \tab If the illusionary creature is a generic monster or NPC--that is, it is a "typical" orc or NPC warrior--there is no need for a special modifier for the subject's saving throw. H
owever, if the illusionary creature is a specific, one-of-a-kind monster or NPC that the subject is familiar with--such as a friend of the subject, or the subject's pet dog--the subject should receive a special modifier.
\par \tab  As with the modifiers for inanimate objects, these factors are not necessarily cumulative. Only in exceptional cases would an illusion result in a saving throw modifier of more than +3.

 is accompanied by other creatures.

\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Magical Effects and Special Attacks}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab Magic is common in most AD&D\'ae campaign worlds, so opponents are not necessarily suspicious of extraordinary effects that appear to defy natural laws.  However, in certain instances, 
illusions that incorporate magical effects or special attacks will require saving throw modifiers. In general, a wizard cannot create excessively bizarre magical effects in his illusion without arousing the suspicion of the subject, adding a saving throw 
modifier of as much as +2.

\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Flaws
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab Illusions are seldom perfect, and wary subjects will always be alerted to an image's illusionary nature by its imperfections. For instance, if a wizard uses a spell such as }{\i\fs24 phantasmal force}{\fs24  to c
reate an illusionary creature, the creature might lack one or more obvious sensory elements, such as sound, aroma, or body temperature, which can be a dead giveaway that the creature is only an illusion. In extreme cases, the subject's saving throw can be
 modified by as much as +4. If the wizard is using a better spell, such as improved }{\i\fs24 phantasmal force}{\fs24 
, any sensory elements lacking in the illusion will not be as obvious, and the subject's saving throw rarely will be modified by more than +2. 
\par \tab Examples:

\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Revealed Illusions
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab As explained on page 84 of the }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook}{\fs24 , if one subject successfully disbelieves an illusion and informs another subject of the illusion, the second subject receives 
a modifier to his saving throw. The amount of this modifier depends on the reliability of the informant and the magnitude of the illusion. If the informant in unreliable and the illusion is formidable (for instance, an illusion of a deadly monster), the s
u
bject might ignore the informant entirely; in this case, no special saving throw modifier applies. If the informant is reliable (the subject's commander or friend), and the illusion is relatively minor (such as the image of a small fire), the subject's sa
ving throw can be modified by as much as +4
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Intelligence}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab It makes sense that a highly intelligent wizard would be able to create more effective illusions. It also makes sense that subjects with low intelligence would be less likely to disbelieve an illus
ion. Therefore, if the caster's Intelligence is exceptionally high (18 or more), the subject's saving throw might be modified by -1. If the subject's Intelligence is exceptionally low (7 or less), his saving throw might be modified by -1. A -2 modifier is
 possible if both the caster's Intelligence is high and the subject's Intelligence is low. 
\par \tab Remember also that characters with exceptionally high Intelligence are automatically immune to low-level illusions. These immunities are summarized on Table 4 of the }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook}{\fs24 . 
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 The Illusion-Casting Subject}{\fs24

\par 
\par \tab For quick reference, Table 14 summarizes all of the situations described above, giving a range of possible modifiers to the subject's saving throw. Again, these are sugggestions only, not hard and fast rules, and the DM is
 free to tinker with them as he sees fit. These modifiers are not necessarily cumulative; in fact, modifying any saving throw for disbelieving illusions by +4 is unusual, while modifying a throw by +6 (or more) should occur only in the most exceptional ci

 Most of the details are left to the DM so he can customize spell research according to the needs of his campaign. If a DM is having trouble devising a us
eable system or is not exactly sure how to proceed, some suggested rules are given below. These rules apply to researching new spells; rules for researching existing spells can be found at the end of this section. Again, all of these rules are optional--t
he DM can make any adjustments or additions that seem reasonable to him
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Defining a New Spell
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab The first step in researching a spell is defining exactly what the spell is intended to accomplish. The player begins by making a rough draft of the proposed spe
ll, including its effects, school, range, duration, and area of effect. The DM will then adjust these elements, making sure the proposed spell does not duplicate the effects of an existing spell, or is not a minor variation of an existing spell. The DM, w
orking with the player, will establish the spell's casting time, saving throw, and, most importantly, its level. (For help with determining the elements of a new spell, see the Spells section in Chapter 2.)
\par \tab Every proposed spell is not automatically acceptable. The DM can veto a proposed spell for any of the following reasons:

), the components for the proposed spell should be established before the research begins. If the spell is of a relatively low level, the components should be fairly simple, but higher-level spells mi
ght require unusually obscure components, such as the cloak of a spectre, the freshly-clipped toenail of a troll, or a handful of dust from the Abyss. (The quest for a needed component makes for an excellent adventure springboard.)  In any case, the wizar

\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Cost of Research
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab Page 44 of the}{\i\fs24  DMG}{\fs24  gives a general range of costs for researching new spells (100-1,000 gp per spell level, plus 1,000-10,000 gp for a laboratory). Following is an alternate way to establish research costs. 
\par \tab There are two categories of expenses required for research: the Basic Investment, and the Operational Cost.  
\par \tab The Basic Investment is a one-time expenditure, representing the funds spent to buy the scrolls and books needed, as well as the funds necessary to assemble a suitable laboratory. 
\par \tab The library costs for each spell level are summarized in Table 15. There are two ways a wizard can avoid the Basic Investment for a library. 
\par \tab 1. The wizard already has a suitable library of his own (see the Wizard's Library section below). \tab 
\par \tab 2. The wizard has access to a large library, such as those existing in major cities or in academies of magic. (The DM decides if a library of acceptable size is available to the wizard). 
\par 
\par \tab The Basic Investment for a laboratory is 1,000-6,000 (1d6 x 1000) gp. The DM determines the cost of the laboratory, either by rolling randomly or setting a specific price. As with the library, there are two ways a wizard can avoid paying the Basic
 Investment for a laboratory: 
\par \tab 1. The wizard has purchased a laboratory previously. Once a wizard purchases a lab, it becomes a permanent part of his possessions. He never has to buy another one unless, of course, it blew up in a lab accident or is otherwise destroyed. 
\par \tab 2. The wizard has access to a laboratory in a major city or at a magical academy. A city or academy that has a suitable library will usually have a suitable laboratory, but the decision belongs to the DM. The DM might also require the wiza
rd to pay a modest weekly rental fee--say, 20-120 (2d6 x 10) gp--for the use of the lab. 
\par 
\par \tab The Operational Cost is an ongoing expense necessary to sustain the research. The Operational Cost must be paid every week and mainly represents the price of additi
onal books, supplies, and scrolls. The weekly Operational Cost is equal to 200-1,200 (2d6 x 100) gp. The DM determines the Operational Cost, either by rolling randomly or choosing a fixed price. There is no way for a wizard to avoid paying the weekly Oper
ational Cost

\par \tab For the most part, books that are suitable for research are hard to find. If a wizard is assembling his library prior to research, assume that it takes 5-10 (1d6 + 4) weeks of searching to locate 1,000 gp worth of books. 
\par \tab Books can sometimes be purchased in the bookshops of any major city or from NPC book collectors. A fortunate wizard may stumble upon such books during his adventures and keep them as he would any other
 discovered treasure; these books, of course, don't cost him any money. The quest for a particular book can be the basis for an entire adventure. (The DM determines the value of any discovered books.)
\par \tab For the purposes of spell research, whether a library 
is of suitable size depends on its value, not its actual number of books. However, as a point of interest, assume that the cost of a single research book varies between 100-1,000 (1d10 x 100) gp. Therefore, a library suitable for researching 4th-level spe
lls is valued at 14,000 gp and contains 14-140 books. 
\par \tab Once a wizard has assembled a library of sufficient value, he can begin research, but he still must pay the weekly Operational Costs. The Operational Costs correspond to the purchase of additional book
s and supplies. Half these Operational Costs can be considered to be new tomes. Therefore, over the course of his research, the wizard's library will increase in value. For instance, assume that a wizard with a 14,000 gp library has a weekly Operational C
o
st of 400 gp to research a 4th-level spell. After he has researched for four weeks, he'll have spent a total of 1,600 gp in Operational Costs and his library will have increased in value 800 gp. (Buying books with Operational Cost funds is assumed to be p
art of the research process and requires no extra time.)
\par \tab As his research progresses, a wizard can opt to spend more than the minimum amount of money required for his Operational Costs in order to buy additional books to increase his chances of successfully
 researching his spell. The effects of these additional expenditures are explained in the Research Time and Chance of Success section below. 
\par \tab When a wizard spends money on library books, whether spent as part of the Basic Investment or as Operational Cost
s, the books then become part of his permanent library. Therefore, once he has assembled a library valued at 14,000 gp, he will never need to make another Basic Investment in library books when he wants to research 4th-level spells. Once he has assembled 
a
 library valued at 74,000 gp, he can research spells of any level without ever making another Basic Investment in books. Clearly, a wizard's library is one of his most precious possessions. The prudent wizard will go to great lengths to keep his library s
afe and protected.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Initial Preparation
\par 
\par }{\fs24 \tab After the Basic Investment is made (or avoided, if the wizard already owns or has access to a suitable library), the wizard must spend preparation time before the actual research begins. This initial preparation inv
olves basic reading and reviewing of notes; in addition, the wizard must prepare himself mentally and physically for the grueling task ahead. This initial preparation lasts a number of weeks equal to the level of the proposed spell, plus one. Therefore, a
 wizard attempting to research a 5th-level spell must spend six weeks in initial preparation
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Research Time and Chance of Success
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab According to page 44 of the }{\i\fs24 Dungeon Master's Guide}{\fs24 , a wizard can check to see if he has successfully researched a spell after
 he has spent the minimum number of weeks required in research. The success check is the same as his chance for learning any new spell. Though this is a simple, straightforward method for checking success, it does not consider the researcher's experience 
l
evel (a more experienced wizard would probably be more successful at researching spells than a less experienced wizard) or the level of the spell (a high-level spell would be more difficult to research than a lower-level spell). Nor does it consider any e
xtra funds the wizard is willing to invest to increase his chances of success. 
\par \tab Following is an alternate method of checking for research success. While more complicated, it produces results that the DM might find more realistic. 
\par \tab The minimum amount of ti
me needed to research a spell is two weeks per spell level; for instance, a minimum of eight weeks is required to research a 4th-level spell. During this time, the wizard is poring over old texts, cross-checking references, taking notes, and conducting ex
periments. 
\par \tab It is essential that the wizard is free from interruption during his research. Since 10-12 hours per day of intensive study are required, a wizard engaged in research is precluded from participating in adventures or any other time-consuming act
ivity.  If a wizard's study is interrupted, the DM can rule that the research has suffered a set-back, requiring an additional amount of research time before success can be checked. 
\par \tab While engaged in research, the wizard must pay the required Operational 
Cost every week.  If he runs out of funds, he must interrupt his research to earn more money before he can resume.  At the DM's discretion, this interruption might also require that the research time be lengthened.  If the wizard's research is interrupted
 
for an extended period--say, a week or more--the DM might require the wizard to start his research all over again. When the minimum research period is over, the wizard can check to see if he has discovered his spell.  If he fails to discover it, he can co
ntinue with his research and check again every week thereafter. 
\par \tab The following formula is used to check for a successful discovery:
\par 
\par Success chance = \{10% (base chance) + researcher's Intelligence + researcher's experience level\} -(level of spell being researched x 2)
\par 
\par \tab As an example, assume that a 7th-level wizard with an Intelligence of 10 is researching a 3rd-level spell. His success chance is equal to 10 percent (base chance) + 10 (his Intelligence) + 7 (his experience level)-6 (the level of the spell, 
multiplied by 2). Therefore, his chance of success is 21 percent. If the DM rolls 21 or less on percentile dice, the wizard has learned the new spell and can add it to his spell books; the new spell is then treated like a normal spell for all purposes. If
 
the wizard fails the check, he can continue his research and check for success again in another week. (Note that this chance of success is somewhat lower than it would be if the wizard were trying to learn an existing spell. But this is logical since the 
uncertain nature of a new spell makes learning more difficult.)
\par \tab The wizard can increase his chance of success by spending more than the required amount of money for his weekly Operational Costs. For every extra 2,000 gp he spends per week (this is in addit
ion to his weekly Operational Costs), his base chance increases by 10 percent. The base chance of 10 percent can be increased to a maximum of 50 percent in this way (the wizard can spend as much as 8,000 extra gp per week).  In our example above, if the w
izard had spent an extra 8,000 gp, his chance of success would have been 61 percent (50 + 10 + 7-6). The extra expenditure applies to the current week only--if he wants to increase his chance again next week, he'll have to spend extra money again
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Example of Research
\par 
\par }{\fs24 \tab 
Following is a step-by-step example of spell research. In this example, an 8th-level wizard with an Intelligence of 12 is attempting to research a 3rd-level spell. This is his first attempt at researching a spell. He has no library or laborato
ry, but he has plenty of money. The DM has decided that no special components are necessary to research this spell. 
\par \tab 1. The wizard has no lab, so the DM determines that the wizard must spend 1,000 gp to establish a suitable lab. \tab 
\par \tab 2. The wizard has no library, so he spends 8,000 gp over the next eight weeks locating the appropriate books. (The wizard must have an 8,000 gp library to research a 3rd-level spell.)
\par \tab 3. The DM establishes the Operating Costs to research this spell at 500 gp per week. 
\par \tab 4. The wizard spends four weeks of preparation time before beginning his research. (The preparation time is the number of weeks equal to the level of the spell plus 1.)
\par \tab 5. The wizard begins his research. He spends six consecutive, uninterrupted weeks in research
, the minimum number required to research a 3rd-level spell. During this period, he invests 3,000 gp in Operating Costs (500 gp for six weeks).  At the end of six weeks, he's ready to check whether his research has been successful. Note that the value of 
his library has grown to 9,500 gp during this period. 
\par \tab 6. The DM determines that the wizard's chance of success is equal to 10 (the base chance) + 12 (the wizard's Intelligence) + 8 (the wizard's level)-6 (the level of the spell, multiplied by 2), which is
 24 percent. The DM rolls percentile dice, and the result is 66. The check fails. (If the wizard gives up at this point, he won't be able to learn the proposed spell unless he starts from scratch at some point in the future; in the meantime, he can consol
e himself with the fact that he has acquired a nice library.) 
\par \tab 7. The wizard continues his research for another week. He spends the required 500 gp for his Operating Costs, but also spends an additional 4,000 gp to raise his success chance by 20 percent (t
he cost is 2,000 gp per 10 percent boost). The increased investment affects the percentage chance for this week only. 
\par \tab 8. At the end of the week, the DM checks again to see if the wizard has been successful. This time, the wizard's chance of success is 44
 percent (the 20 percent increase represents the additional investment of 4,000 gp). The roll is 34, so the wizard is successful--he can add the new spell to his spell book. 
\par \tab If the check had failed again, the wizard could continue the research for as many weeks as he is willing, until either his patience or his money run out. He must pay the Operational Costs each week. 
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Researching Existing Spells}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab In addition to researching new spells, a wizard can research existing spells (those listed in the }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook}{\fs24 
 and--if the DM allows them--the new spells from Chapter 8 of this book). Since it makes sense that information about existing spells is easier to find than information about spells that do not yet exist, it is easier for a wizard to research them. 

\par \tab To account for this difference, make the following adjustments in the above procedures when a wizard is researching an existing spell: 
\par \tab 1. The Operational Cost is reduced to 100-600 (1d6 x 100) gp per week. 
\par }\pard \li270\nowidctlpar\tx-1440\tx-720\tx270\tx720\tx1495\tx2136\tx2883\tx3631\tx4378\tx5019\tx5767\tx6514\tx7262\tx8010{\*\pn \pnlvlcont\ilvl0\ls0\pnrnot0\pndec }\adjustright {\fs24 2. The base chance of success is increased
 from 10 percent to 30 percent. 
\par }\pard \nowidctlpar\tx-1440\tx-720\tx270\tx720\tx1495\tx2136\tx2883\tx3631\tx4378\tx5019\tx5767\tx6514\tx7262\tx8010{\*\pn \pnlvlcont\ilvl0\ls0\pnrnot0\pndec }\adjustright {\fs24 \tab 
The lab costs, library costs, preparation time, and minimum number of weeks for researching existing spells are the same as research of new spells. The cost of increasing the base chance is also the same (2,000 gp per 10 p
ercent increase), as is the total amount that can be spent (8,000 gp). Notice, however, that spending the 8,000 gp maximum increases the base chance to 70 percent (20 points higher than the 50 percent limit when researching new spells.) 
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Limiting the Success Chance}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab Notice that a wizard's chance of successfully researching a spell could exceed 100 percent, particularly when a high-level wizard is researching an existing low-level spell. Although automatic success is certainly in the spirit of the game (ac
cording to Table 4 of the }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook}{\fs24 
, all wizards of 19th level and above have a 100 percent chance of learning new spells), some DMs might prefer to eliminate any chance of automatic success. If so, we suggest requiring that all wizards must roll f
or success, even if their calculated chance exceeds 100 percent; a roll of 95 or higher is treated as failure.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 More About Magical Item Research}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab Magical item research is discussed in detail on pages 84-88 of the }{\i\fs24 Dungeon Master's Guide}{\fs24  and needs little elaboration here. However, a few points are worth mentioning:
\par 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Laboratories:}{\fs24  The laboratory requirements for researching magical items are different than those for researching spells. Spell research requires shelving, easels, writing tools, files, and simil
ar supplies, while item research requires test tubes, beakers, burners, chemicals, and other equipment. \tab 
\par \tab Consequently, a wizard who invested in a spell research laboratory will still need to buy equipment to research an item. For example, assume that a w
izard just spent 5,000 gp on a laboratory for spell research, and now wants to research a new potion. The basic cost for an alchemical laboratory is 2,000 gp (see page 87 of the }{\i\fs24 DMG}{\fs24 
). Since the 5,000 gp laboratory is useless for potion research, the wizard must spend 2,000 gp for alchemical equipment. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Libraries:}{\fs24  Just as a wizard's spell research lab is relatively useless for item research, so is his spell research library. However, a sizeable library of magical tomes probably contains short-cuts, hints, a
nd formulas that will help the wizard in his item research. At the DM's discretion, access to a sizeable library (say, with a value of at least 74,000 gp) can increase a wizard's chance of success by as much as 10 percent. Access to a library doesn't chan
ge the amount of time it takes to research and create an item, nor does it change the amount of money that must be spent. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Specialist Bonus:}{\fs24  If a specialist is researching an item that duplicates an effect of a spell from his school, his chance of success 
can be increased by as much as 10 percent. If the DM uses this rule, he should also deny a specialist the chance to research an item that duplicates a spell effect from any of the specialist's oppositional schools. The researcher's school has no effect on
 the amount of research time required, nor does it affect the amount of money that must be spent. 
\par }{\b\fs32\cf2 
\par Chapter 8: New Spells

\par \tab This chapter includes a variety of new spells that can be used to supplement the choices provided in the}{\i\fs24  Player's Handbook}{\fs24 . These spe

\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab In accordance with the listings in the }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook}{\fs24 
, material components are given below for the spells that require them. The DM must decide the precise amounts of these materials, as well as any other details about them. For instance, }{\i\fs24 color spray}{\fs24  requires a "pinch" of c
olored sand--the DM decides what exactly constitutes a "pinch." Likewise, }{\i\fs24 dancing lights}{\fs24 
 requires a glowworm--must the glowworm be alive, or can it be a preserved specimen? Less fussy DMs can allow their wizards as much latitude as they wish with material components, as long as they meet the general requirements of the spell description

\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Verbal and Somatic Components}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab The DM makes the decision regarding precise verbal and somatic components for any spell, although suggestions from players should be conside
red; specific verbal and somantic components are not required, but they add color to the game by giving players a clearer idea of exactly what procedures must occur in order for their PC wizards to cast spells. Requiring specific components can also make 
f
or some challenging game situations. For example, if a wizard is gagged, he may be prevented from casting spells with spoken verbal components. Similarly, a wizard with his hands bound behind him may have problems casting a spell whose somatic component r
e
quires specific hand gestures. (See Chapter 6 for more information about impaired casters and spell components.) Verbal components can be single words, brief phrases, snatches of poetry, chants, or nonsense syllables. They can be spoken, whispered, shoute
d, or sung. Verbal components can also be groans, grunts, coughs, whistles, or any other vocally-produced sound. 
\par \tab Often, the verbal component will relate to the effect of the spell. For instance, the verbal component for}{\i\fs24  feather fall}{\fs24  might be the whispered word "float," while a low, eerie moan might work for }{\i\fs24 detect undead}{\fs24 . }{
\i\fs24 Dimension door}{\fs24  might be the spoken word "open," while the verbal component for }{\i\fs24 gust of wind}{\fs24  might be a slow exhalation of air. Somatic components can be any type of physical gesture. For 
some spells, merely touching or pointing at the target or subject is sufficient. More elaborate gestures are suitable for higher-level spells. In many cases, the somatic component will relate to the spell's effect. For instance, the somatic component for 
}{\i\fs24 audible glamer}{\fs24  might require the caster to put his hand to his ear as if he were listening. Rapidly rubbing the hands together might suffice for }{\i\fs24 chill touch}{\fs24 
, while wiggling the fingers like a spider might serve as the somatic component for }{\i\fs24 web}{\fs24 .

\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Five Unusual Sources For Spells}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab When a wizard learns a new spell, he usually acquires it from a teacher, a discovered spell book, another wizard, or 
his own research. But there are many more ways to learn new spells--some of the more unusual possibilities are listed below (in all cases, the wizard must successfully learn a new spell once it is revealed to him)
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 1. Dragons}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab Most dragons are masters of magic. A friendly dragon might teach a wizard a new spell as a reward for helping him or as a bribe to leave him alone. 
\par \tab The DM should note that the magic of dragons is significantly different from the magic normally wielded by wizards, so it is unlikely 
that a wizard could learn to cast a spell in the same manner as a dragon; however, a dragon of exceptional intelligence might know the formula for a spell useable by humans (or know where to find it) and reveal the information to a wizard
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 2. Monuments}{\fs24 
\par 
\par  \tab 
Ancient obelisks, monoliths, and other structures are occasionally inscribed with the formulas of spells. Locating such a monument can be an adventure in itself. For instance, a wizard who died thousands of years ago may be entombed in a pyramid in the he
art of an unexplored jungle; prior to his death, the wizard inscribed the formulas of his spells on the walls of his tomb so he could have access to them in the afterlife
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 3. Other Planes
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab The alternate planes of existence are filled with an unending varie
ty of weird phenomena, strange landmarks, and bizarre entities. A wizard might find a magic formula spelled out in giant runes stretched across an entire plane of the Abyss. Or he might stumble across a horde of ape-like creatures in the plane of Elysium 
c
hanting the formula of a spell. The inhabitants of the elemental plane of Fire might know the secrets of a variety of fire-related spells, while the occupants of the elemental plane of Earth might be willing to share the formulas for earth-related spells 
in exchange for a favor
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 4. Summoned Creatures
\par 
\par }{\fs24 \tab A creature summoned as a result of }{\i\fs24 invisible stalker}{\fs24 , }{\i\fs24 monster summoning}{\fs24 
, or a similar spell might negotiate for his freedom by offering to teach the caster a spell or show him where to find a spell formula. I
f the summoned creature is exceptionally knowledgeable, it might be able to dictate a formula to the wizard; it might even be able to cause a spell formula to magically appear in his spell book (in which case, the wizard has his normal chance to learn it;
 if he fails, the spell formula disappears). 
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 5. Gems, Crystals, and Mirrors}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab Magic-using creatures from other planes of existence sometimes use gems, crystals, or mirrors as substitutes for spell books to record the formulas of their spells. Although wiz
ards from the prime material plane are ordinarily unable to use such items to record their own spells, a DM might allow that a wizard could stumble across such a gem or mirror; if the wizard studied the item, a cloud of mist might materialize inside it, c
ontaining the symbols of a spell formula

\par 
\par  \tab Following are several afflictions that affect only wizards. These afflictions can occur as a result of a curse, a side-effect of magical research, or a penalty from a wish. Assume that 
an affliction can strike at any time--short of a wish, there is no way a wizard can inoculate himself to prevent the onset of these afflictions. 
\par \tab Unlike some organic diseases, suffering from one of these afflictions does not render a caster immune to futu
re bouts with one of these conditions. A spell caster who survives one of these diseases is equally as likely to suffer the disease again in the future as a caster who has never contracted the disease. 
\par \tab The DM can use these afflictions to temporarily handicap a powerful PC wizard or to liven up a dreary stretch of a campaign. Unless indicated otherwise, all afflictions can be cured by }{\i\fs24 cure disease}{\fs24 
 or a similar spell. Unless the DM decides that a particular affliction was a result of a magical attack or effect, }{\i\fs24 dispel magic}{\fs24  will not help. 
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 1. Bertrek's Amnesia}{\fs24 
\par 
\par  }{\b\fs24 \tab Description:}{\fs24  The wizard afflicted with Bertrek's Amnesia has trouble remembering all of the details of his memorized spells. Just as he attempts to cast the spell, he suddenly forgets a crucial ele
ment of its formula, and the spell fails to work. The onset of Bertrek's Amnesia is usually preceded by a day or two of mild headaches. The mild headaches persist as long as the wizard is afflicted with this condition. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Susceptibility:}{\fs24  Bertrek's Amnesia can strike any wizard, but it seems to affect wizards with Intelligence scores of 14 or less. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Prognosis:}{\fs24  A full day of bed rest usually cures this condition, presuming the wizard refrains from casting spells, studying texts, or engaging in other strenuous
 mental activities. Without rest, the affliction can persist indefinitely. 
\par  \tab }{\b\fs24 DM's Notes:}{\fs24  When a wizard is afflicted with Bertrek's Amnesia, he must make an Intelligence Check when attempting to cast a spell. If the check is successful, the spell is cast n
ormally. If he fails the check, the spell is lost in a fizzle of useless energy and is wiped clean from the memory of the caster until it can be rememorized. 
\par \tab After every full day of rest, the DM rolls 1d20 to see if the wizard is cured; if the roll is le
ss than or equal to the wizard's Intelligence score, the wizard is cured. Otherwise, the wizard is automatically cured after he has been afflicted for 2-8 (2d4) days

\par \tab }{\b\fs24 DM's Notes:}{\fs24  A wizard with this affliction glows as if affected by a 1st-level }{\i\fs24 light}{\fs24  spell. This does not affect his ability to cast spells, but he will find it difficult to hide from enemies.}{\i\fs24  Cure disease
}{\fs24  and similar spells have no effect on chronic incandescence. If }{\i\fs24 darkness, 15' radius}{\fs24  is cast on the afflicted wizard, he can make a save vs. magic; if he fails the check, his conditio
n is negated. Likewise, if he fails a check against }{\i\fs24 dispel magic}{\fs24 
, his condition is cancelled. These spells can only be attempted once each on an afflicted wizard. The afflicted wizard cannot cast these spells on himself. If these spells are unavailable, or
 if he successfully saves in both cases, the condition disappears in 1-4 days

\par 
\par  \tab }{\b\fs24 Description:}{\fs24  An extremely dangerous disease, blacksickness causes the afflicted wizard to weaken every time he attempts
 to cast a necromancy spell. In extreme cases, afflicted wizards have died from this disease. The affliction is accompanied by stomach cramps, blurred vision, and nightmares. Its onset is usually preceded by several days of nausea. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Susceptibility:}{\fs24  Barlow's blacksickness primarily affects necromancers. It can also strike any wizard who knows and uses necromancy spells. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Prognosis: }{\fs24 This is a difficult affliction to treat. Strangely, the very act of casting the spells associated with the disease also seems 
to help cure it. Otherwise, the affliction can linger anywhere from a few days to several weeks. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 DM's Notes:}{\fs24  A wizard afflicted with blacksickness risks suffering damage whenever he casts a necromancy spell. When an afflicted wizard casts a necromancy sp
ell, he must make a Constitution Check, with the level of the spell used as a negative modifier. (For instance, if the wizard has a Constitution of 13 and casts a 4th-level necromancy spell, he adds 4 to his 1d20 roll when he makes his Constitution Check.
 ) If he passes the check, there are no ill effects. If he fails the check, he suffers 1-4 hit points of damage. Regardless of whether he fails his Constitution Check, the spell is cast normally. 
\par \tab There are two additional side-effects of blacksickness. 
\par \tab 1
. If the afflicted wizard suffers 6-10 hit points of damage in the same day as a result of failing Constitution Checks required for casting necromancy spells, he will experience wracking nightmares when he sleeps that night. Throughout the following day, 
he will experience blurred vision and stomach cramps, and will make all attack rolls at a -2 penalty. }{\i\fs24 Cure disease}{\fs24  or similar spells have no effect on this condition. 
\par \tab 2. If the afflicted wizard suffers 11 or more hit points of damage in the same day as a 
result of failing Constitution Checks required for casting necromancy spells, he will immediately collapse. He will be unable to cast spells, engage in combat, or undertake any other strenuous activities for the next 24 hours. (He can still walk without a
ssistance, but his movement rate is halved.) 
\par \tab }{\i\fs24 Cure disease, dispel magic}{\fs24 , and similar spells have no effect on blacksickness. Aside from a wish, there are two known cures. 
\par \tab 1. The DM secretly rolls 2d6. This is the number of necromancy spells the afflicte
d wizard must cast in order to purge his system of the blacksickness. The necromancy spells can be of any level; for instance, if the wizard needs to cast four spells, they could all be 1st-level spells, they could all be 9th-level spells, or they could b
e
 any combination of necromancy spells from any level. Each time a necromancy spell is cast, the afflicted wizard must still make a Constitution Check and suffer the effects as described above. (Obviously, the wizard's health is safer if he refrains from c
asting more than one or two necromancy spells in the same day.)  
\par \tab The DM does not reveal to the wizard the total number of spells he needs to cast to cure himself--instead, the DM should tell the wizard that he's gradually getting better after he casts eac
h necromancy spell. The DM can tell the wizard that he is cured after he has cast the last required spell, then has cast one subsequent necromancy spell that gives him no ill effects. 
\par \tab 2. Blacksickness persists for 4-32 (4d8) days. The DM should determine
 the length of the affliction at its outset, but not reveal the information to the wizard. If the wizard has not yet cured himself, the affliction is over at the end of this period.

\par \tab 2. In Stage Two, the afflicted wizard's skin remains white, but his body has the consistency of firm gelatin. He continues to suffer the -1 penalty to his Charisma. His natural Ar
mor Class is also increased to 7. Because of this improved AC, some afflicted wizards allow their condition to advance to Stage Two before attempting a cure. At this stage, immaterialism can be cured with }{\i\fs24 cure disease}{\fs24 
, but the afflicted wizard must make a saving throw vs. spells; if the wizard succeeds in his saving throw, he resists }{\i\fs24 cure disease}{\fs24  and remains afflicted with immaterialism. Untreated, Stage Two persists for 2-8 (2d4) days. 
\par \tab 3. In Stage Three, the wizard and all of his gear become insubstantia
l; he appears as if he were made of glass, but he has no substance. The afflicted wizard cannot cast spells, engage in combat, or take any other action aside from moving and speaking. He has a -4 penalty to his Charisma. However, the wizard is affected on
l
y by magical or special attacks, including weapons of +1 or better (such attacks are made against the wizard's normal AC). The afflicted wizard is able to pass through small holes or other narrow openings as long as Stage Three persists. At this stage, im

\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 4. Absorption/Adsorption
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab This is a method for purifying gases or liquids by exposing them to charcoal particles or other filtering substances; the impurities are attracted to the particles, thus purifying the gas
 or liquid. If the impurities are actually taken inside the particles, then absorption has taken place. If the impurities remain on the surface of the particles, then adsorption has occurred.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 5. Flame Test
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab This is a method of identifying unknown substances by holding them in a hot flame. The color of the flame indicates the nature of the substance; for instance, a green flame indicates the presence of copper.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 6. Chromatography
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab This is a simple method for analyzing certain types of unknown substances. 
The substance is first dissolved in water or other liquid. A sample of the liquid then is poured into a glass tube lined with filter paper, and a solvent is added. Because the components of the substance move through the filter at different speeds, each w
ill appear as a different colored band in the tube.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Eleven Useful Additions to a Wizard's Laboratory
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab A wizard's laboratory typically includes a variety of books, crucibles, flasks, jars, tripods, herbs, and even a skeleton or two. Following are several l
ess common but extremely useful items that might be found in an especially well-furnished laboratory. The cost of each item is given in parentheses,
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 1. Granite Table Top
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab This is an ordinary desk with a top made of polished granite or quartzite to resist staining and damage from acids and other potent substances. (150 gp)
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 2. Glass Mask
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab This is a face mask made of glass designed to protect the wizard from inhaling poisonous fumes and to protect his face from splashed chemicals. (10 gp)
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 3. Alchemist's Globe
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab This 3-foot-diameter glass globe separates into two sections. When assembled, the sections form a tight seal that prevents air from entering. Items and substances can be locked inside the globe to isolate them from outside conditions. Small and larg
e globes are available. (150-250 gp)
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 4. Athanor
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab A small furnace consisting of an oven and a deep pan of sifted ashes. Substances to be heated are placed in a sealed container and covered in ashes for slow, even heating. (80 gp)
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 5. Descensory Furnace
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab This is a medium-sized furnace primarily used for heating liquids. The liquid is poured down a funnel on the top which runs into a container in the belly of the furnace. (100 gp)
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 6. Heat Bath
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab This is a small furnace holding a deep pan of water containin
g metal rings to hold variously sized flasks and tubes. The substance to be dissolved is placed in a glass tube, which in turn is placed in an appropriately-sized ring in the pan. The furnace gradually heats the water and thus the substance. (75 gp)

\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 7. Dung Bed
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab This item consists of a box made of glass or other non-flammable material with a tight-fitting lid. The box is filled with hot dung or clean, dry sand. Treated substances are placed in the dung bed to keep them warm. (25 gp)
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 8. Analytical Balance
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab An extremely precise scale for weighing solid materials, the balance is sensitive enough to distinguish a blank piece of paper from a paper with writing on it. To keep it dust-free, the balance is covered with a glass case. (400 gp)
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 9. Burette
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab This is a thick tube with a valve on one end used to measure liquids precisely. (1 gp)
\par 
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 10. Filter Paper
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab This is a specially treated paper that filters solids from liquids. A funnel is lined with the paper, then the liquid to be filtered is poured in the funnel. Solid material will not pass through the paper. (1 gp/10 sheets)
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 11. Hand Centrifuge}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab This is a machine consisting of several rings for holding test tubes with a hand pump on the top. Test tubes filled with liquids are placed in the rings, then the w
izard rapidly works the pump, causing the tubes to spin in a circle. The spinning causes the heavier substances in the tubes to sink to the bottom, while the lighter substances remain near the top of the tube. (100 gp)
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Four Prerequisites For Admission to an Academy of Magic
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab While some wizards are self-taught and some acquire their skills from a private tutor, many wizards learn the art of magic at a training academy. Most large cities have such academies; some specializing in a particular school of magic
, while others offer training in all of the schools. Usually, there are a minimum of three requirements for admission to an academy.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 1. Sponsorship
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab All applicants to an academy must be recommended by a sponsor known by one or more of the faculty members
. Exceptions are made if an applicant is an orphan or demonstrates extraordinary aptitude, but in these cases, a faculty member must agree to sponsor the applicant; the faculty sponsor is then personally held responsible for the applicant's failure or suc
cess.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 2. Personal Interview
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab Because training a wizard requires a major investment of time and effort, academies screen their applicants carefully to make certain that a prospective student is sufficiently dedicated to persevere through years of rigorous 
education. Typically, a panel of faculty members interviews each applicant individually, quizzing him at length about his background, his interests, and his reasons for wanting to become a wizard. The panel then votes in secret; a single negative vote res
ults in the rejection of the applicant.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 3. Entrance Examination
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab Following a prospective student's successful interview, he is given a battery of examinations to measure his aptitude in a variety of academic areas. The student must demonstrate a basic com
petence in philosophy, literature, and history, and exceptional skills in writing, science, and mathematics. He must also pass a physical examination to make sure he is in good health.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 4. Tuition Fees
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab If a prospective student passes his entrance examina
tions, he must then make arrangements with the academy administration to pay tuition fees. The tuition fee ranges from 5-20 gp per day, depending on the academy's reputation. The tuition can be paid daily, weekly, or monthly, but it must be paid in advanc
e. Failure to pay tuition results in immediate suspension, unless the student has made previous arrangements with the administration. 
\par \tab The tuition covers the cost of books, laboratory fees, faculty salaries, and room and board, but it does not include expe
nses for spell components, research materials, or damage caused by the student in his research. Occasionally, scholarships are available for unusually promising students. 
\par \tab After a student is admitted to an academy, he must undergo a probationary period la
sting a minimum of six months. During this time, the student's classroom performance is evaluated on a weekly basis and his behavior both on and off campus is closely monitored. If the student is not performing adequately in the opinion of any faculty mem
ber or adminstrator, he may be dimissed from the academy. Except in the most extreme circumstances, he is not eligible to apply for readmission. No amount of the tuition paid prior to his dismissal is refundable.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Nineteen Courses in a Typical Academy Curriculum
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab The course of study varies from academy to academy, but most include the classes described below. Usually, all of these classes are required to graduate, but the DM might decide to vary them according to the needs of a specific student or the educa
tional philosophy of a particular faculty. \tab 
The length of time necessary to graduate also varies from school to school, depending on the student's aptitude, the intensity of the training, and the quality of the faculty, but generally, four to six years of 
full-time study are required to graduate from an accredited academy. This period can be lengthened by as much as two to four additional years if the student specializes in a particular school. 
\par \tab A student usually takes four to six courses per quarter, with
 each quarter lasting three months. A minor course, such as Survey of Literature, might last only a single quarter, while a major course, such as Spell Tutorial, might be taken every quarter until the student graduates. An average course lasts one to two 
hours per day, four to six days per week. 
\par \tab The curriculum of a typical academy of magic includes the following courses.
\par

\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Nine Organizations For Wizards
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab Wizards are most comfortable in the company of their fellow pr
actitioners, especially those with whom they share common interests, and often form their own associations and organizations. A few such groups are listed below. The DM is encouraged to design variations of these groups; for instance, a Necromancy Syndica
te, a variation of the Diviners Syndicate, might exist in a particular DM's campaign world. 
\par \tab Each organization's description includes the following information: 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Description:}{\fs24  The purpose of the group. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Membership:}{\fs24  The types of wizards belonging to the group. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 New Member Requirements:}{\fs24  Conditions a prospective member is expected to meet in order to join the group. Usually, this consists of paying an entrance fee or being sponsored by a current member. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Annual Dues:}{\fs24  The fee that a member must pay each year to remain an active member. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Benefits:}{\fs24  The advantages of being a member.
\par 
\par  }{\b\fs24\cf2 The Brotherhood of Alchemy}{\b\fs28\cf2 
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Description:}{\fs24  This group consists of wizards whose primary interest is alchemical research, particularly the research of new magical potions. The group
 compiles and exchanges information about their current projects, with the implicit understanding that such information will not be shared with outsiders. Violation of this rule results in immediate expulsion from the Brotherhood. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Membership:}{\fs24  The bulk of the members are transmuters, though a few enchanters and invokers are also included. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 New Member Requirements:}{\fs24  New members must pay an entrance fee of 100 gp and show evidence of original magical item research within the last year. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Annual Dues:}{\fs24  20 gp 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Benefits:}{\fs24  The Brotherhood can help its members obtain hard-to-find research supplies and laboratory equipment. They can also offer assistance to members who have reached a dead end in their research.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Legal Defense Front
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Description:}{\fs24  This group provides legal defense to wizards unjustly accused of criminal activity. Their services include legal representation, financial support, and personal counseling. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Membership:}{\fs24  Any wizard of lawful good alignment can be a member. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 New Member Requirements:}{\fs24  A new member must be sponsored by a current member and must pay an entrance fee of 200 gp. The entrance fee may be waived on a majority vote. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Annual Dues:}{\fs24  50 gp 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Benefits: }{\fs24 If a member is accused of a crime, the Front will provide 1,000 gp or more toward his def
ense. The Front can also provide expert witnesses and legal representation if necessary. Their counseling service advises members about the acceptance of magic-users in various cities and cultures, giving special attention to places where magic-users are 
routinely persecuted and imprisoned for minor infractions of the law.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 The Silver Swan Club
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Description:}{\fs24  Primarily a social organization for unmarried wizards, the Silver Swan Club holds regular dances, picnics, and other social events for its members. Th
e highlight of the year is the annual Harvest Moon Festival, when the club stages an all-night party in a rented castle. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Membership:}{\fs24  All wizards are welcome, but the membership comprises mainly young, low-level wizards. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 New Member Requirements:}{\fs24  A new member pays an entrance fee of 20 gp. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Annual Dues:}{\fs24  5 gp 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Benefits:}{\fs24  The club provides its members with excellent opportunities to meet potential friends and mates.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Wizards' Liberation Society
\par 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Description:}{\fs24  This organization seeks to further the interest
s of wizards through political pressure on local and national governments. Their methods include negotiation, demonstrations, and one-on-one lobbying. Some factions are rumored to use violence to underscore their messages. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Membership:}{\fs24  All wizards are eligible. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 New Member Requirements:}{\fs24 
 A new member must be sponsored by a current member and pay an entrance fee of 50 gp. The fee is waived if the prospective member has exploitable political connections (for instance, if he is related to a government official). 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Annual Dues:}{\fs24  10 gp 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Benefits:}{\fs24  The Society can exert considerable influence on governments to adopt laws beneficial to wizards. The Society can also put its members in contact with government officials and assist them in working with government burea
ucracies.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Foes of the Wand
\par }{\fs24 
\par  \tab }{\b\fs24 Description: }{\fs24 This is an organization of purists who adamantly oppose the use of magical wands or any other magical devices. Such devices are perceived to be a threat to the craft of magic; only the use of spells is acceptable
 to the Foes of the Wand. If a member is ever caught using a magical item, he is immediately expelled. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Membership:}{\fs24  All wizards are eligible, but the membership is primarily composed of older mages of higher levels. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 New Member Requirements:}{\fs24  The only req
uirement for a prospective member is the donation of a magical item to the Foes. The Foes then destroy the item in a solemn ceremony, after which the prospective member vows never to use a magical item again. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Annual Dues:}{\fs24  None 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Benefits:}{\fs24  Once per year, 
each member can exchange a magical item for a spell of comparable power. The magical item is destroyed, then the Foes allow the member to copy one spell (of their choice, not the member's) from their spell books.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Diviners Syndicate
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Description:}{\fs24  More of 
a business than a fraternal organization, the Diviners Syndicate sells advice, predictions, and omen interpretations to members of the aristocracy. Their fees are expensive, but because the syndicate pools the talents of a sizeable number of skilled wizar
ds, their advice and predictions are extremely accurate. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Membership:}{\fs24  Only diviners of eighth lever or higher are eligible. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 New Member Requirements:}{\fs24  The prospective member must pay an entrance fee of 500 gp and bring at least one new client to the syndicate. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Annual Dues:}{\fs24  There are no annual dues. However, to remain in good standing, a member must spend a minimum of eight weeks per year working exclusively for the syndicate. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Benefits:}{\fs24  Members in good standing split the syndicate's profits at the end of the year. A member's annual share is usually 5,000-30,000 (1d6 x 5,000) gp.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Center for Monster Control}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Description:}{\fs24  This organization compiles information about magical monsters and makes this information available to its members at no charge. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Membership:}{\fs24  All wizards who have first-hand knowledge of magical monsters are eligible. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 New Member Requirements:}{\fs24  A new member must pay an entrance fee of 10 gp. Additionally, the prospective member must have first-hand knowledge of a magical monster or a monst
er wielding magical powers (such knowledge is usually acquired as a result of a battle). The membership votes on whether the prospective member's knowledge is of sufficient usefulness to the organization to allow him membership. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Annual Dues:}{\fs24  None if the member attends all bi-monthly meetings. The member may be assessed a fine if too many meetings are missed without good reason. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Benefits:}{\fs24  The organization supplies information to its members about magical monsters, including their abilities, their weaknesses, and suggested strategies for defeating or avoiding them. 
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 League of Extraplanar Travelers}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Description:}{\fs24  Similar to the Center for Monster Control, this organization compiles information about alternate planes of existence and makes this information available to its members at no charge. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Membership:}{\fs24  All wizards who have visited one or more alternate planes of existence are eligible. \tab 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 New Member Requirements:}{\fs24  A new member must pay an entrance fee of 20 gp. Additionally, the prospective member must 
have proof of a visit to at least one alternate plane of existence. The membership votes on whether the prospective member's knowledge of that plane is of sufficient usefulness to the organization to allow him membership. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Annual Dues:}{\fs24  None if the member attends all bi-monthly meetings. A fine may be assessed if a member misses too many meetings without good reason. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Benefits:}{\fs24  The organization supplies information to its members about the alternate planes, including inhabitants, physical laws, and how spe
ll casting is affected (the DM should consult Chapter 6 for details about magic in other planes--the league has all of this information available to its members).
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Fellowship of Sages
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Description:}{\fs24  This is an organization of sages who are expert in a wide variety of subjects. The sages charge for their advice, giving a percentage of their fees to the Fellowship for its upkeep. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Membership:}{\fs24  All types of wizards belong to the fellowship, each with one or more areas of expertise. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 New Member Requirements:}{\fs24  A prospective member must pay an entrance fee of 100 gp, plus he must have a nonweapon proficiency in one or more of the fields of study listed on Table 61 of the }{\i\fs24 Dungeon Master's Guide}{\fs24 
. If the wizard is a recognized authority in one of the fields of study not available as a nonweapon proficiency in the DM's campaign, he can still be admitted to the fellowship with the DM's permission. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Annual Dues:}{\fs24  None. However, each member must provide 15 percent of the fees he charges for his sage advice to the fellowship. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Benefits:}{\fs24 
 As long as a member spends a minimum of eight weeks per year working exclusively for the syndicate, he has access to the advice of the other members at no charge. If he fails to spend the minimum of eight weeks per year, he must pay their n
ormal fees. Advice is given according to the rules for sages on pages 106-107 of the}{\i\fs24  DMG}{\fs24 . However, the chances listed on Table 61 (page 107 of the }{\i\fs24 DMG}{\fs24 
 ) of finding a sage in the fellowship who is expert in a given field are doubled; for instance, there is a 20 percent chance of finding an expert in alchemy. When using the Sage Modifiers table (Table 62 of the }{\i\fs24 DMG}{\fs24 
 ), assume that a fellowship sage always has access to a complete library.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 400 Fantastic Materials}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab Occasionally, the DM will need to introduce a
 fantastic magical material into his campaign. Such a material might be required as an ingredient for a PC wizard's magical research (especially if the DM is using the fantastical approach to magical fabrication described on page 84 of the Dungeon Master'
s Guide), it might be the focal point of a quest, or it might be a necessary component to remove a curse. 
\par \tab If the DM has no specific material in mind, he can generate one by rolling 1d20 two times on Table 19. The first die roll selects an element from Cat
egory A; the second die roll selects an element from Category B. The selected elements become part of this phrase: "The (Category A) of a (Category B). " For instance, if the first die roll is 3 and the second die roll is 5, the fantastic material is "the
 breath of a butterfly."
\par \tab If he desires, the DM can simply pick elements from each category to form specific materials. He can also substitute similar elements for the choices in Category B. For instance, he might substitute "bumblebee" for "butterfly" (so 
the example above becomes "the breath of a bumblebee") or "diamond" for "stone."
\par \tab If random rolls produce results that seem inappropriate or frivolous (such as "the breath of a stone"), the DM can roll again for either category or substitute any category choice he wishes. \tab 
Unless the DM has a specific meaning in mind, the players must discover the precise meaning of a fantastic material or the means to produce or locate it. Discovering the meaning of a fantastic material can easily become the premise for a new adventure.

\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 The Island of Ghothar
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab This island is the former stronghold of the master conjurer Ghothar. Ghothar mysteriously vanished several centuries ago, and left t
he bulk of his magical treasures secured in a chamber in the deepest recesses of his island. Not only is the treasure cache rumored to be of incomparable value, it is also said to include one of Ghothar's spell books, containing the formulas for many high
-level conjuration spells. 
\par \tab The Island of Ghothar is enchanted to continually drift in random directions at speeds up to 25 miles per hour. There have been no confirmed sightings in over a century, meaning that the island conceivably could have drifted anywhere in the world

\par \tab The island resembles a cylinder about 50 yards in diameter and about 165 yards tall. Nearly three-fourths of it is submerged, meaning that only about 35 yards of the island is above sea level. The i
sland is made of granite; the granite is permanently surrounded with a}{\i\fs24  wall of force}{\fs24 , making it virtually invulnerable to damage. 
\par \tab The island is divided into five levels, each about 25 yards tall from top to bottom (except for Level 1, which corresponds to the surface of the island). The floors are solid granite nearly 10 feet thick, permanently covered with }{\i\fs24 
wall of force}{\fs24 . 
\par \tab The only passageways between levels are the magical portals located at various points on the floors (see map). The portals are 5-foot
-diameter rings made of black and white pearls imbedded in the granite. The portals are completely airtight. When a creature or person touches the granite area inside the ring of pearls, the creature or person is instantly transported to a specific locati
on on the island. The destination of each portal is indicated in the Map Key

\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 The Sphere of B'naa
\par 
\par }{\fs24 \tab The Sphere of B'naa is located in a cavern beneath one of the world's highest peaks. Its precise location is not known. The sphere was created eons ago by a consort of wiza
rds led by a high-level mage named B'naa. The sphere supplied transport for the wizards to alternate planes of existence. Because of the magic involved in creating and sustaining the sphere, it is extremely difficult to use and virtually impossible to use
 by non-wizards
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24 About the Spheres}{\fs24  
\par 
\par \tab Refer to Map 2. 
\par \tab The sphere is located in an immense cavern at the end of a 200 yard long passage winding deep inside the earth beneath an ancient, towering mountain range. The sphere consists of several layers (like a
n onion), each about 20 feet thick. The layers are separated from one another by bands of shimmering white light. The portal to the alternate planes lies in the center of the sphere; to get to the portal, a person must pass through each layer. 
\par \tab Once the m
agical requirement for a layer has been met, characters may pass through the layer of shimmering light to the next layer. If any character passes back through a light layer that he has already passed through, the magical condition must be met again in ord
er to re-enter that light layer. Characters may pass freely toward the outer spheres (for example, from layer 4 to layer 3). 
\par \tab Each layer is permanently enchanted with special features representing the various levels of wizard magic; for instance, the first
 layer of the sphere represents 1st-level wizard magic, the second layer represents 2nd-level wizard magic, and so on. If the proper level of spell is cast on a layer, its features change dramatically; these spells can either be cast on the layer itself o
r on any subject inside the layer. Magical items that duplicate the effects of spells do nothing to change the features of the plane, nor do priest spells. The effects are explained in detail in the Map Key.

\par 
\par \tab The Sage Tree is a huge oak tree about 10 feet in diameter and over 100 feet tall. It grows somewhere in one of the world's densest forests. The Sage Tree contains the spirits
 of a dozen of the wisest scholars who ever lived. After the scholars died, the gods of good rewarded their devotion to pure knowledge by placing their spirits in this oak so they could engage in philosophic discussions for all eternity. 
\par \tab If a wizard loca
tes this oak (recognizable by a slight pulsation near its trunk that resembles a heart beat), he can ask it any question as if he were consulting a wise sage for information (the wizard can ask any question relating to the fields of study listed on Table 
61 of the }{\i\fs24 DUNGEON MASTER Guide}{\fs24 ).  The Sage Tree will only respond to wizards of lawful good alignment, and it will answer only one question per day. 
\par \tab If these requirements are met, two to five (1d4 + 1) human faces will sprout from the tree in an area five
 to ten feet above the base of the trunk. The faces appear to be carved from wood. One of the faces will politely ask the wizard to repeat the question, then another face will offer an answer. Immediately, a second face will offer a different answer. If t
here are additional faces, they too will offer different answers. 
\par \tab After all of the faces have offered their answers, they will ignore the wizard and engage in a heated argument as to who is wrong and who is right. The argument will continue for at least 2
-8 (2d4) rounds, during which time the argument will drift off into topics completely unrelated to the wizard's question. At some point in the argument, one of the heads will abruptly ask the wizard for his opinion to settle their argument--the head will

\par \tab This 1-foot-square piece of parchment can hold any monster summoned by a}{\i\fs24  monster summoning I}{\fs24 
 spell. The wizard unfolds the parchment and lays it before himself prior to casting the spell. If the spell is successfully cast, the summoned monster is immediately ab
sorbed into the parchment, appearing there as a colored image. The caster can then refold the parchment and carry it with him, holding the summoned monster indefinitely. When the parchment is unfolded and laid on the ground, and the wizard speaks a comman
d word, the monster appears, remaining active for the normal duration of the}{\i\fs24  monster summoning I}{\fs24 
 spell. Any single parchment of monster holding can be used only once; after the monster is released, the parchment crumbles to dust. The parchment also crumbles if it is torn or defaced in any way.

\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Airboat}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab This appears to be a canoe made of stone and measures 3 feet tall, 12 feet long, and 4 feet wide. Inside are five evenly spaced stone planks, each capable of 
seating two human-sized passengers. A plank on one end of the canoe is marked with a star symbol in the center. The }{\i\fs24 airboat}{\fs24  is also fitted with two sets of stone oars that fit in ridges carved in both sides of the craft. 
\par \tab The }{\i\fs24 airboat}{\fs24  responds to the mental orders of its commander (the character sitting on the plank with the star symbol). Only a wizard or priest can serve as an }{\i\fs24 airboat}{\fs24  commander. 
\par \tab The }{\i\fs24 airboat}{\fs24  can move in any direction in any medium. While moving, the }{\i\fs24 airboat}{\fs24  is surrounded by an aura of lig
ht that allows all of its passengers to breathe normally, even when traveling through water or airless space. The aura surrounds the craft to a distance of 10 feet. 
\par \tab The }{\i\fs24 airboat}{\fs24  has a movement rate of 40. It can move only if it is being rowed with at leas
t one set of the stone oars. If only one set is used, the craft has a maximum movement rate of 20; if both sets are used, the craft has a maximum speed of 40. A single character can operate two oars, or two characters can sit side by side on a plank, each
 
operating an oar. To move at maximum speed, the rowers must complete a stroke every two seconds; if the stroking rate is less than this, the maximum speed decreases proportionately. For instance, if one set of oars is stroking once every four seconds, the
 }{\i\fs24 airboat}{\fs24  has a maximum movement rate of 10. 
\par \tab The commander must remain seated on the star plank. He can take no actions other than commanding the craft. If he moves from his seat, attempts to operate the oars, or takes any other action, the }{\i\fs24 airboat}{\fs24  stops m
oving. Similarly, if his concentration is interruped, the craft stops. If it stops moving while in the air, it hovers in place. The }{\i\fs24 airboat}{\fs24 
 can hover in place for only 1 turn, after which it sinks gently to the ground. If it stops moving while on water, the boat simply drifts.
