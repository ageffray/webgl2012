\par }{\b\fs32\cf2 Introduction\tab 
\par }{\fs24 
\par Since the creation of the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS\'ae game system, the cleric has been one of the most popular character classes. He has been a happy bridge between warriors and mages: Capable of armoring up and wie
lding heavy weapons, capable of casting useful magics, he was a very versatile adventurer and the favorite choice of countless players.
\par \tab With the release of the AD&D\'ae 2nd Edition game, none of that has changed. The cleric is the same magic-hurling, mace-wielding hero that he always was. And in }{\i\fs24 The Complete Priest's}{\fs24  }{\i\fs24 Handbook}{\fs24 
 , we're going to see to it that he's even more than that.
\par \tab In this supplement, we're going to elaborate on what the priest (including the cleric) }{\i\fs24 is}{\fs24  to the campaign, to the setting's civilization, and to the adventuring party.
\par \tab We'll be providing guidelines for the DM to work up the cleric's faith: The god or philosophy he serves, the rules and mores he follows, the duties he practices, the restrictions he suffers, the powers he possesses
, and the relations he and the others of his faith have with the followers of other faiths.
\par \tab We'll show you how to work up priests devoted to specific mythoi. The druid, from the AD&D\'ae 2nd Edition  }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook}{\fs24 , is one example; this supplement describ
es many, many more, and provides rules for the DM to create new priesthoods of his own design.
\par \tab We'll talk about priestly orders. Some priesthoods have soldierly orders, scholarly orders, missionary orders, oracular orders, and many other types. If your pr
iest character belongs to a faith with several orders, he may choose one of them, which will give him special abilities and duties beyond those of ordinary priests.
\par \tab We'll talk about role-playing the priest character. Certainly, priest characters don't have to have the same sort of identical personality (the kindly father-confessor with the bloody mace in his hand) which many players imagine them all to have.

\par \tab We'll describe whole campaigns devoted to priests: How to run them, how to give them a purpose, how to determine what goals and interests are most appropriate.
\par \tab And we'll talk about the sort of equipment that priests use in their devotions and adventures, including weapons, armor, holy symbols, priestly vestments, and other items.
\par \tab  }{\i\fs24 The Complete Priest's Handbook}{\fs24 
  is equally useful if you're a Dungeon Master or a player. It will add depth to the campaign world and the range of NPCs for Dungeon Masters, and add detail to the abilities, backgrounds, and responsibilities of player-character priests.

\par \tab In the text, for reasons of simplicity, we normally use masculine nouns and pronouns inclusively. When we say "god," "priest," or "man," we're normally also implying "goddess," "priestess," and "woman."
\par \tab In order to be able to use this supplement, you must use the Weapon and Nonweapon Proficiencies rules from the AD&D\'ae 2nd Edition game. If you're not yet familiar with them, you ought to read them before continuing in this rulebook.
\par A special note for those of you who are using this }{\i\fs24 Complete Priest's Handbook}{\fs24  with your original AD&D\'ae game instead of the new edition: This supplement mentions a lot of page numbers from the }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook}{\fs24 
 and the }{\i\fs24 DMG}{\fs24 . The page numbers cited are for the newest edition, not the original; they won't be correct for those of you using the old books.

\par }{\b\fs32\cf2 Priests, Gods, and the World}{\b\fs24 
\par 
\par }{\fs24 \tab This chapter is for DMs who want to design the mythic history of their campaign world(s). It's not prohibited for the campaign's players to read this . . . but not all of them will find it
 useful. Players may wish to skip on to the third chapter, "Sample Priesthoods."
\par \tab  
\par \tab One of the first things the DM can do to add color and detail to his campaign world is to work up that world's }{\i\fs24 mythic history}{\fs24 . Such a history will help establish, in his m
ind and those of his players, the relationships between the gods, and between gods and men. It will help set the tone of the campaign and the attitude of the player-characters' culture. It will give the players some idea of what their characters expect fr
om their gods and their future. And once it's done, the DM can then elaborate on it and decide how each individual god relates to other gods and to the sentient races of the world.
\par \tab In this chapter, we'll discuss some of the common themes that run through myths; the DM can use these topics as a framework for his own mythic history.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Creation}{\fs24 
\par \tab 
\par \tab The first place to start is the creation of the universe and the world.
\par \tab In most creation stories, there was usually some disinteresting, stable condition in effect at the dawn of time. It might have been a formless void, or darkness, or unending ice and snow.
\par \tab Then, we have the first great being, the one who brings about creation of the world. Note that this great being doesn't have to be the god who is now dominant i
n the campaign world. The myths are packed with tales of gods who created their worlds, became oppressive, and were then cast down by other gods, even their own children, who now rule in their place.
\par \tab Nor does the creation have to have been a deliberate event. It might have been an accident; the god could have been dreaming and his dreams became reality.
\par \tab The creator could be a tremendous monster, one which began the process of creating the world, but was overthrown before it finished making the world to its own satisfaction . . .  and one which, legends say, will return some day to finish the job.

\par \tab It could be a simple creature, one not necessarily deserving of worship, which shapes the world simply by acting as the animal it is. As one example, if the orig
inal state of the universe were a giant block of salt, this creature could be a giant cow which licks it into the shape of the world.
\par \tab In some mythologies, the great being that shapes the world stays around after that task is done; he or she might be the p
rincipal deity of the world. More often, that great being perishes, or is cast down by descendants, or settles for a lesser role once creation is accomplished.
\par \tab  
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Basic Astronomy}{\fs24 
\par \tab 
\par \tab What is the shape of the world and the universe once they are created? What are suns, moons, planets and stars?
\par \tab The entire universe could be a single huge world, with a dome overhead which holds the stars and confines the sun(s) and moon(s). The world could be a disk, a sphere, a bowl, or an unending surface continuing in all directions to infinity.
\par \tab The sun and moon could be glowing chariots, or bright gods continually flying across the sky (p
erhaps as a service to the world, perhaps because they're being chased). They could be worlds unto themselves, and the player-characters might someday have the opportunity to visit and walk the bright surface of the sun in search of adventure. They could 
b
e the great, glowing eyes of the most powerful deity. They could be gigantic, fiercely-burning lamps created by the craftsman-god, lamps which circle the world on some giant mechanism. (Perhaps, instead of circling the world, they just shut off each day w
hen the time is due; the sun just turns off, and the moons just turn on.) They could even be suns and moons as we understand them, though some of the charm of fantasy lies precisely in making such things }{\i\fs24 different }{\fs24 
from our cold, modern explanations of them.
\par \tab 
The planets and stars could be holes in the dome of the sky, suggesting that there is a great brightness beyond. They could be decorations placed in the sky by the gods. They could be worlds unto themselves. They could be glowing creatures forced to trac
e paths through the sky every night. They could be the suns of distant worlds.
\par And, of course, the DM can choose for all these astronomic bodies to be one thing, but for the prevailing belief of the people to be different, an incorrect belief; nothing says that the world's deities want the humans and demihumans to know the truth.

\par \tab 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Effects of Terrain on Creation}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab  In the real world, the terrain of the human culture to which a mythology belonged often had a strong effect on the myths. Norse mythology started with a huge abyss filled with ice, for instance.
\par \tab  If one race's religion is dominant in the campaign world, the DM should decide whether or not their creation-story has a setting like the land where that race originated.  
\par \tab In a fantasy world, this situation could come about from one of two reasons:
\par \tab The gods, having emerged from a particular type of terrain, would find similar terrain in the mortal world to be their favorite land for creating new races, exploring, and interacting with humans; or
\par \tab The sentient races might have erroneously re-interpreted the story of the world's creation as a reflection of the terrain in which they live, and the legend is simply wrong.
\par \tab  
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Propagation
\par }{\fs24 \tab 
\par \tab Once creation of the world and universe are established, the DM can move on to the propagation of the gods. In other words, once the setting is in place, the cast of gods gets larger and larger.
\par \tab Naturally, the DM can always do this the other way around. Perhaps all the gods were in place before they decided to create the wo
rld. There's nothing wrong with this choice; it's simply backward from the way the best-known Earth mythologies operated.
\par \tab Regardless, unless the DM is creating a monotheistic faith (one dedicated to only one deity), he must now begin creating the other gods of the faith.
\par \tab These gods could be children of the first great being. They could be that being's creations instead. They could be representations of natural forces brought to awareness and life by the catalyst of Creation. They could emerge from some le
ss wholesome process (for example, they could be created by the decay of the body of the first great being, or could merely spring forth whole from its corpse: One god from the bones, one from the brain, one from the heart, etc.).
\par \tab Each god should have some special }{\i\fs24 attribute}{\fs24 
 , an area where he or she is dominant. Some can have several attributes. Such attributes include Thought, Strength, War, Love, Craftsmanship, Earth, Sea, Sky, Sailing, Farming, Hunting, and many, many others. Any activity that is import
ant to humans (or demihumans) can be an attribute for a god.
\par \tab Not all these gods need to have been "first-generation," or born to/created by that first great being. Obviously, some should be. But they, too, can create or become parents to other gods.
\par \tab In s
ome mythoi, the god of a particularly important attribute will have children who bear lesser forms of that attribute. For instance, the god of Love might have children who represent Passion, Marriage, Infatuation, and Unrequited Love. The god of Sleep mig
ht have children who represent Dreams and Nightmares. The god of Intellect might have children who represent Memory, Poetry, Song, and Riddles or Puzzles.
\par \tab  
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Characteristics of the Gods}{\fs24 
\par \tab 
\par \tab The DM can create as many gods for his pantheon as his imagination w
ill allow him. He doesn't have to work up an extensive set of legends about every god; even in the real world, many gods of various mythologies were scarcely more than a name and an attribute. As his campaign continues, the DM can flesh out the descriptio
ns of these gods to his heart's content.
\par \tab Some of the traits which characterize the gods, and can be defined by the DM for each god or pantheon, include:
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Immortality:}{\fs24  Are the gods immortal? In most pantheons, the gods are certainly}{\i\fs24  ageless}{\fs24 ; that is, they d
o not grow old. But in some, they are not just ageless, they also cannot be killed; regardless of how severely they might be wounded, with time they will always fully recover from injury. In others, the gods can be killed by sufficient force. For example,
 in the Greek myths, the gods are undying, while in the Norse myths the gods face eventual certain death at the battle of Ragnarok.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Indestructibility:}{\fs24  As a further level of what was just described, some gods which are immortal are also described as indestr
uctible. No force on heaven or Earth can hurt them (except by hurting their feelings, by betraying them). This is sometimes the trait of the greatest god of a pantheon, and is usually the trait of the only god of a monotheistic religion (one which believe
s in only one god).
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Influence on the World:}{\fs24  How much influence does the god have on the mortal world, the world
 of animals, the world of plants? With some gods, there is very little of such influence. A god whose attribute is the unchanging stars, for instance, might exert a little influence on the sailors who navigate by stars, but could have very little effect o
n
 anyone or anything else. On the other hand, gods relating to powerful human emotions or preoccupations (such as love, war, creativity, and so forth) might exert a great deal of influence on the world, especially if it is said that every application of hi
s attribute requires the god's help or permission. For instance, if it requires the aid or permission of the god/goddess of childbirth for every human birth to take place, then that deity is exerting a profound effect on the world.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Interest in the World:}{\fs24  A
dditionally, some gods are very interested in what goes on in the mortal world, while others are entirely disinterested. Naturally, those who are interested are more prone to meddle in mortal affairs than those who aren't. In fact, gods who are disinteres
ted in the world might punish characters who are bold enough to call upon them.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Intentions Toward the World:}{\fs24  Finally, there's the question of what the god's intentions are toward the world . . .  especially toward the sentient races of the world. Some gods
 are content just to pursue their attributes and make sure they are properly worshipped and recognized. Others may have more far-reaching plans. This is especially true of evil gods, who wish to bring about the destruction of races, other gods, or the ent
ire world; it is also true of ambitious gods, who wish to cast down the ruling gods, take their place, and reshape the world to their own liking.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Inhibitions:}{\fs24  Some gods and pantheons had limitations placed upon them. These might have been limitations place
d by some greater power of the universe, or merely enforced by the greatest of the gods. Often, these inhibitions dictate how much aid or hindrance the gods can offer to mortals, whether or not they can help their favorite men and beasts directly or indir
ectly, etc.
\par \tab  
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Example
\par }{\fs24 \tab 
\par \tab As an example of how a familiar god matches these characteristics, let's look at the Greek goddess Aphrodite.
\par \tab She was immortal, as were most or all of the Greek gods. She certainly was }{\i\fs24 not}{\fs24  indestructible, and was in fact once wounded in battle by the Argive hero Diomedes.
\par \tab She had a very profound influence on the world, for it was she who put all varieties of the emotion of love in the breasts of man and beast. Even the other gods, with the exception of Hestia, Athena, and Artemis, were regularly affected by her power.

\par \tab Her interest in the world was limited to a couple of areas: Making sure that all humankind respected her (which generally meant that all humans knew love at one time or another, and thus did not deny her); and making
 sure her special favorites, such as her mortal son Aeneas, survived and prospered. Other than that, she appeared to have no special intentions toward the world.
\par \tab Aphrodite had a couple of inhibitions restricting her: First, she and all the Olympians were 
subject to a higher destiny, which not even Zeus could thwart. Second, physically, she and most other gods could be hurt or even defeated in battle by the mightiest Greek heroes. Third, the god-king Zeus obviously preferred for gods to help their favorite
s indirectly rather than by showing up in person. All these inhibitions affected the way Aphrodite and the other Olympians related to their favorite "player-characters."
\par \tab  
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Humans, Humanoids, Animals, Plants}{\fs24 
\par \tab 
\par \tab At some point in the history of the gods, they probably created all living things. (It's possible for the flora and fauna of the world to have been created by some other factor. For example, they might have just }{\i\fs24 been}{\fs24 
 there when the great ice-cap melted. But it's a more common element of the story that the gods created them.)
\par \tab This creation process might have involved an accident; for instance, the greatest god sneezed, and blew fully-formed living things all over the world.
\par \tab More commonly, it's a deliberate process, and the gods or one particular god methodically created all the living things known to man. 
\par \tab 
\par \tab When working up this aspect of the story for his own campaign world, the DM can use this to help define the way the gods look upon specific forms of life. Was Man created so the 
gods would have something entertaining to watch? To fulfill a higher destiny? So that his brightest and best might one day add to the ranks of the lesser gods, or accompany the gods on one last, great battle? This kind of decision helps define man's view 
of the gods and their requirements of mankind.
\par \tab It can also be used to define mankind's opinions on certain matters. If, for instance, animals in general were created to serve Man, then Man might have little regard for them, except as pets and beasts of bur
den. However, if each god created one or more animals to serve as totems for the god, then Man might have a lot more respect for certain animals.
\par \tab If the story of creation says that one sex of the sentient races was created subordinate to the others, then 
there will be a crushing social pressure to keep that sex "in its place." If the story of creation does no such thing, then any such attitudes will be have been created by mortals and may vary from place to place. Additionally, with the added complication
 of }{\i\fs24 several }{\fs24 
sentient races around (humans, elves, dwarves, etc.), the DM can make this decision several times and choose a different approach each time. Perhaps, on his world, dwarves are strongly male-dominated, elves are female-dominated, and humans are m
ore or less equal? Any such arrangement is possible.
\par \tab Note, however, that when one sex is oppressed, players are less likely to want to play members of that sex. Few players want their escapism to involve this sort of prejudice directed at them.
\par \tab  
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Fall From Grace}{\fs24 
\par \tab 
\par \tab In some stories, humans or sentient races in general start out with an exalted relationship with their deities and then fall out of the deities' favor. In Greek myth, for example, the humans were well-beloved of the gods until the god Promethe
us gave them the secret of using fire, which they had lacked until then; this so offended Zeus that he afflicted mankind with all sorts of ills.
\par \tab This sort of thing could be a characteristic of your campaign world's story; or, mankind might never have had a closer relationship with its gods.
\par \tab  
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 The Challenge}{\fs24 
\par \tab 
\par \tab In many faiths, the gods, deliberately or not, visit a challenge on the humans.
\par One of t
he commonest challenges involves the afterlife. In many faiths, the better one lives one's life, the better the afterlife to which he progresses. The usual sorts of afterlives tend to fall into one of the following categories; in some faiths, a character 
might face the possibility of reaching more than one of these choices, depending on his actions in life.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Oblivion:}{\fs24  No afterlife at all, this is when the human's spirit perishes and becomes nothingness.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Torture:}{\fs24  An afterlife where torture, either permanent or temporary (until the spirit repents, recants, or otherwise improves) is the order of the day.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Boredom:}{\fs24  An afterlife where there's nothing to do, nothing to see, nothing to entertain.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Rebirth:}{\fs24  An afterlife which involves rebirth in the physical world and the living of a new mortal life.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Pleasure}{\fs24 : An afterlife where the things man most loves in life are visited upon him in abundance.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Ascension:}{\fs24  An afterlife where the best of the best are granted great powers, making them heralds and messengers of the  gods . . .   or even gods themselves.
\par \tab In such faiths, humans usually have a good idea of what it takes to get into these specific afterlives. To get into the "good" ones may require strict adherence to a certain life-style, or may require that the human 
somehow impress the gods with his deeds or personality, or may merely require that the gods like the character . . .which is not something the character can necessarily bring about deliberately.
\par \tab Other challenges are possible: Humankind as a whole might be
 challenged to achieve a certain level of civilization by a certain time, to achieve a certain level of artistic or philosophic ability, to defeat a certain spirit of evil, to evolve to a certain enlightened state, etc.
\par 
\par \tab  
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 The Future}{\fs24 
\par \tab 
\par \tab Some, but not all,
 faiths make predictions for the future. Sometimes they're grim, such as the Norse belief in Ragnarok, the destruction of the gods and man. They could also be happy and cheerful . . . though this isn't usually the case in a world involving great heroes.

\par \tab The DM, when deciding whether or not to "predict the future" for his world, should try to figure out what this choice will do to the attitudes of his intelligent races.
\par A future which is bleak and gloomy will sometimes make the campaign bleak and gloomy. Th
e characters can hope for success and glory in the short-term, but certain death awaits them, and they can't count on the world being there "when they get back." This sort of approach does make for the greatest of heroism, though. It's the greatest hero w
ho strives on knowing that ultimately he must fail, yet fights for his goals anyway.
\par \tab A future which is happy and bright will sometimes make the campaign a little more goofy and irresponsible. Characters, believing that whatever their mistake, they'll be pr
eserved or rewarded, may behave in a foolish manner. Acts of bravery are often nothing of the sort; they're just short-term sacrifices in anticipation of a long-term reward. This is not to say that such a campaign can't be rewarding . . . it's just harder
 for it to be serious.
\par \tab A future which is neither doomed nor excessively happy will tend to have less of an effect on the player-characters. For instance, if holy writings say that a thousand years in the future, the gods will "start over" and reshape the w
orld, populating it with the survivors from the last world and the best spirits in the halls of the afterlife, that's all very interesting . . . but its effects on the current campaign are minimal. On the other hand, if this reshaping is supposed to take 
place in only ten years, or one, it becomes }{\i\fs24 very}{\fs24 
 interesting to the PCs. They'll work very hard to make sure that they're either among the survivors from this world, or among the brighter spirits of the afterlife, so they can experience the new world.
\par \tab Of course, the DM doesn't }{\i\fs24 have}{\fs24  to specify future events for his campaign. It's often better if he doesn't, because it makes for more uncertainty in the minds of the PCs.
\par \tab 
\par \tab  
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 The Pantheon}{\fs24 
\par \tab 
\par \tab Once the DM has created the individual gods, he ought to relate them to one another # that is, establish how they feel about one another. This can affect how their mortal followers, especially priesthoods, feel about one another and work together.

\par \tab These r
elationships don't have to be very detailed. It's quite sufficient to say that one god loves another, hates another, likes another, dislikes, respects, holds in contempt, whatever. Then, simply apply that sentiment to the priesthoods of the gods.
\par \tab And when that sentiment is applied to mortals, it can turn out to be greater or less than the emotion actually felt by the gods in question.
\par \tab For instance, let us say that two gods dislike one another. Their respective priests may dislike one another with similar intensity. On the other hand, they }{\i\fs24 might not dislike one another at all}{\fs24 
. They might, in fact, recognize that their gods have certain foibles (human-like failings of personality), and might look upon those foibles with amusement and affection but without following them themselves.
\par \tab However, these priesthoods instead }{\i\fs24 might loathe one another}{\fs24 . They could hate one another with an intensity which far surpasses that of the gods in question. They could, in fact, start wars on the earth because of their hatred for 
one another.
\par \tab So, for many gods, the DM may wish to decide how the gods feel about one another, and then may choose a slightly different view of how their priests react to one another.
\par \tab  
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Events}{\b\fs24\cf2 
\par }{\fs24 \tab 
\par \tab Once all the principal characters (i.e., gods) are in place, the DM can create the }{\i\fs24 events}{\fs24  of the faith.
\par \tab The creation of the world was one such event; it described "characters" (gods) acting or interacting, and something happening. The fall from grace of the sentient races was another: How did that happen? But th
ese shouldn't be the only events known to the believers. What else has happened?
\par \tab Do the gods mate with mortals to produce heroic characters who go on adventures? If so, then the conception of these heroes and their adventures in life are all events of the
 faith. (Note: If this process is still going on, some of the campaign's player-characters could be the mortal children of the world's gods.)
\par \tab How do specific gods get along together? Having determined that, the DM can next determine why. If two gods hate each other, why? Did one steal from the other, or embarrass him? That's an event.
\par \tab Have the gods ever warred on one another? If so, that was certainly an event.
\par The DM can create as few or as many events as he wishes; the more there are, the richer his campaign setting will be for it.
\par \tab  
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Forces and Philosophies}{\fs24 
\par \tab 
\par \tab The mystical history of the world is somewhat different if it is driven by a }{\i\fs24 force}{\fs24  or a }{\i\fs24 philosophy}{\fs24 .
\par \tab As we'll discuss in more detail next chapter, a }{\i\fs24 force }{\fs24 is a mystical power which strongly affect
s the world . . . but which probably is not a sentient being like gods are. It has drives, it has a goal, but it probably does not have a mind.
\par \tab On the other hand, a}{\i\fs24  philosophy}{\fs24  is a compelling idea or set of ideas which can capture the imagination and infl
uence the actions of communities or whole civilizations. It might exert enough popular appeal that it can support magical powers for priest-philosophers. But it is still not precisely a god, for it has no independent mind.
\par \tab If your campaign world is driven
 by a force or philosophy, its mystical history is going to be somewhat different. It will mostly be a history of men or other sentient races and their relationships with the force or philosophy: How they came to recognize it or create it, how they came t
o believe in it, how they introduced it to others, and so forth.
\par \tab In short, the DM won't have to create an entire separate history as he would have to do for distinct pantheons of gods. He will, however, have to decide for himself what effects these forces 
or philosophies have had on the human and humanoid histories of his world, and take these factors into account for every part of those histories.
\par \tab  
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Mythic History Creation Sheet}{\fs24 
\par \tab 
\par \tab The DM can photocopy and fill in the following sheet to give him a starting-place for the creation of his world's mythic history. The sheet follows the order of subjects from this chapter.
\par \tab  
\par *   *   *
\par 
\par \tab In this chapter, we discussed creation of the }{\i\fs24 history}{\fs24  of the campaign's gods. In the next chapter, we'll talk about individual faiths, how they're put together, and what effect they have on priest-characters.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs32\cf2 Designing Faiths}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab  This chapter is for DMs who want to design detailed faiths and cults for their 
campaign worlds. It's not prohibited for the campaign's players to read this . . . but not all of them will find it useful. Players may wish to skip on to the next chapter, "Sample Priesthoods."  
\par \tab  
\par \tab  As the }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook}{\fs24  points out (page 34, first column), "In the simplest version of the AD&D\'ae
game, clerics serve religions that can be generally described as 'good' or 'evil.' Nothing more needs to be said about it; the game will play perfectly well at this point."  
\par \tab That's true enough. But DMs who work
 to make their campaign settings into interesting, detailed backgrounds for the campaign, won't be satisfied with that simple approach. A big part of the color of any fiction setting, including campaign settings, is the relationship of the supernatural wo
rld to the "real" world . . . and gods, with priests as ambassadors to the human world, form a big part of that supernatural element.
\par \tab So, eventually, most DMs will want to work up at least the basic details of who the gods are in his campaign world, how th
ey relate to one another, and what their goals are (especially those pertaining to the mortal world). This, in turn, will let them enhance the role of cleric, druid and other priest player-characters in the campaign . . . and that's what this chapter is a
ll about.
\par \tab In this chapter, you'll learn how to create specific faiths (related to specific gods, natural forces, and philosophies); how to create the priests of these specific mythoi; and how to relate the gods together into a full-sized pantheon for your 
game world. In the next chapter, you'll find many examples of this priesthood creation process.
\par \tab  
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 God, Force, or Philosophy}{\fs24 
\par \tab 
\par \tab For each faith you establish in your campaign world, you have to decide what it is that's being worshipped and venerated: A God, a Force, or a Philosophy.
\par \tab A }{\b\fs24 God}{\fs24  is a powerful being, usually of human or greater intelligence, usually desiring to impose its will or characteristics upon the world. A god is often devoted to a single attribute or set of attributes (e.g., warfare, love, 
agriculture, marriage, etc.) and so most of his interactions with the world will deal with the god's promotion of that attribute among humankind. Gods do not have to be anthropomorphic (i.e., manlike in form or personality characteristics), and so one fai
th's god is often another faith's monster. However, most of the gods worshipped by player-characters are likely to be anthropomorphic and not monstrous.
\par \tab A }{\b\fs24 Force}{\fs24  is some sort of natural (or unnatural) process which influences the world. It isn't necessarily
 intelligent, but it is magically powerful . . . and humans who accept the dictates and goals of this force can become its priests and use spells based on that magical power. Some Forces which can be so worshipped include Entropy, Nature, the Life-Death-R
ebirth Cycle, and Magic. Druids tend to be priests of the Force of Nature, instead of specific Gods of Nature. (There are exceptions to that generalization, of course.)
\par \tab A }{\b\fs24 Philosophy}{\fs24  is an idea, or set of ideas, which (in these magical worlds) is so compell
ing that it attracts magical energy and faith to it, much as a Force does. Philosophies are usually created by man or other sentient races, spread throughout cultures, and gain such widespread acceptance and belief that they do become much like Forces. Wh
e
n no one believes in a Philosophy any longer, it can generate no magical power and support no priests, so the priests' duty is to embody its attributes and to teach the philosophy so that it will never die. Sample philosophies include Oneness With Nature,
 Peace, the Divinity of Mankind, the Sanctity of Life, Nihilism, and so on.
\par \tab In the AD&D\'ae game, the God, Force, and Philosophy are identical in the way they are treated by the game mechanics. All three provide spells and powers to their priests. All three d
emand personal requirements and services of their priests and of their non-priest followers. And all three, to a lesser or greater degree, shape the world, both through their own powers and through their agents, the priests.  
\par \tab  
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Ethos and Requirements of the Faith}{\fs24 
\par \tab 
\par \tab Each faith requires certain codes of behavior, beliefs, and even abilities of its followers and of its priests. When creating a faith, you have to decide what those requirements are and how they're to be implemented in your campaign.
\par \tab  
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Goals and Purposes}{\fs24 
\par \tab 
\par \tab First, what are the goals and purposes of the god (or force or philosophy), and therefore of the faith?
\par \tab Often, that's self-evident, because it's usually tied to the attribute of the god, or the explanation of the force or philosophy.
\par \tab For example, if the faith's god is a God of Love, then the goals and purposes of the faith will probably include:
\par \tab  }{\b\fs24 Promotion of Love}{\fs24 , which might include the helping along of lovers, opposition to those who interfere in the development of romantic relatio
nships, punishment of those who defy the god and refuse to love, etc. This could also include "social services" to the community, through the god's temples: Counseling to young lovers, for instance.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Promotion of the God}{\fs24 , which includes the building of temples or churches, carrying the word of the god to those who have not heard it, and keeping the stories of the god ever-present in the ears of the population.  
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Opposition of Enemies}{\fs24 , which means subtle or direct opposition to enemy gods and their followers; obviously, a god of Love is likely to be opposed to a god of Hatred, Misanthropy, Misogyny, etc.
\par \tab Those are some basic goals, but you obviously aren't limited to goals which are that direct and simple.
\par \tab For instance, a god may represent only a small par
t of his attribute. A God of War does not have to be just a god of all types and elements of warfare. He could be the God of the Chaos of War, the God of Intelligent Warfare, the God of Naval Warfare (in which he might share traits with a god of Oceans), 
the God of the Sword (in which case he might share traits with a god of Metalworking), and so forth. If you choose, you can always make a god's personal attribute more specialized, and can choose more specialized goals for the faith based on that choice.

\par \tab In addition, a god isn't defined just by his attribute. In the campaign history, he also has a personal history, likes and dislikes, relationships with other gods, and ambitions, all of which can provide more goals for the faith.
\par \tab As one example, Zeus, the 
king of the gods of Greek mythology, had many attributes and associations. He was the king of the gods, a sky-god, a god whose emblem and weapon was the lightning bolt, a god of Wisdom (he had swallowed and absorbed the wisdom-goddess Metis, mother of Ath
e
na), a god of oracles (though he was eventually supplanted by Apollo in this role, he had a major oracle at the city of Dodona), a protector of fugitives, a lover of many goddesses and women . . .  In short, he had many characteristics and attributes, and
 in an AD&D\'ae game campaign his priesthood would embody and promote most or all of them.  
\par \tab  
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Alignment
\par }{\fs24 \tab 
\par \tab A faith will often demand that its priests belong to a specific alignment or a limited range of alignments. The DM determines this, usually basing the choice on the attributes and character of the god, force or philosophy in question.
\par \tab But don't be too restrictive in this regard. Even if, personally, you're opposed to War, the God of War and his followers don't have to be Chaotic/Evil.
\par \tab  
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Alignment Guidelines for the Priesthood}{\fs24 
\par \tab 
\par \tab Here are some general guidelines to go by:
\par \tab The first, and most important, note is this: The gods usually do not insist that their priests be of }{\i\fs24 identical}{\fs24  alignment to the god. The alignment may not be so dissimilar that the pri
est cannot serve the god, but it does not have to be identical.  
\par \tab If the faith does not promote any sort of harm to living beings, or promotes benefits to living beings, then it probably excludes Evil alignments among the priesthood. If the faith allows f
or harm to living beings but does not promote wanton cruelty, then it can include Good, Neutral, and Evil priests. If the faith does promote cruelty, then it probably excludes Good alignments among its priests.
\par \tab If the faith demands ordered thinking, strict obedience to laws, and unquestioning acceptance of policy, then it leans toward Lawful behavior. (Now, every faith requires rituals and devotions of its priests, but this}{\i\fs24  isn't}{\fs24 
 the same thing, and doesn't require any alignment choice.) If the faith deman
ds more free-willed and spontaneous behavior, defiance of social conventions or restrictions, and so forth, then it leans toward Chaotic behavior. If it promotes neither approach strongly, then it can probably include Lawful, Neutral, and Chaotic choices.

\par \tab Here are some sample choices:
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 God of Love:}{\fs24  This type of faith usually promotes no harm to living beings, and promotes the benefits of love; it often promotes free-willed and spontaneous behavior, but not strongly. Therefore, its priests will probably be 
required to be Good, and may be of Lawful, Neutral, or Chaotic alignments, though the tendency is toward Chaotic. However, if the god is a god of passionate affairs and selfish love, regardless of who gets hurt, and if he promotes revenge on romantic comp
etitors and ex-lovers, then the faith could well include Evil and Neutral priests, thus giving its priesthood the full range of alignment choices.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 God of War:}{\fs24  This faith generally allows for harm to living beings without promoting wanton cruelty; and warfa
re runs the gamut from carefully-reasoned strategy to wild, bloodthirsty battlefield chaos. Therefore, the faith probably places no restriction on the alignment of its priests. However, a specific god can be devoted to one aspect of war. For example, a go
d who promotes the bloody destruction of all enemies, including sacrifice of prisoners and innocents, will probably have an Evil priesthood. A god who is the god of military planning will probably have a Lawful, or Lawful and Neutral, priesthood.
\par \tab  
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Alignments of the Worshippers}{\fs24 
\par \tab 
\par \tab Most faiths define various acts and types of behavior as evil and demand that their followers not perform those acts. Some few make those same definitions and demand that their fol
lowers do perform them. Almost no faiths demand that their followers belong specifically to Lawful or Chaotic alignments.
\par \tab Therefore, most faiths require of their (non-priest) worshippers that they be anything but Evil. A very few faiths require instead that their worshippers be any sort of Evil (Lawful/Evil, Neutral/Evil, or Chaotic/Evil). 
\par \tab  
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Ability Scores}{\fs24 
\par \tab 
\par \tab Most priesthoods demand some sort of minimum ability scores of their priests.
\par \tab The prime characteristic of priests is Wisdom. To be a priest of any sort whatsoever, the character must have at least a wisdom of 9. Some priesthoods will require that the wisdom score be higher, though usually not higher than 13.  
\par \tab Generally, if the priest's Wisdom is 16 or better, he gets a +10% bonus to his earned experience.
\par \tab Many priesthoods will require a second prime requisite. For example, priests of a god of War may have to have a certain Strength score, while priests of a god of Magic might have
 to have a certain Intelligence score. Usually, this second prime requisite must have a score of at least 12; up to 15 is not an excessive requirement. 
\par \tab In such cases, the DM may decide that the character, if he has }{\i\fs24 either}{\fs24  the Wisdom score or the other Prime Requisite at a score of 16, gets a +5% bonus to earned experience, but if he has }{\i\fs24 both}{\fs24 , he gets a +10% bonus.

\par \tab In the next chapter, you'll find numerous examples of such priesthoods and recommended minimum ability scores for them.
\par \tab  
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Races Allowed}{\fs24 
\par \tab 
\par \tab The DM may wish to limit certain priesthoods to certain races.
\par \tab This is almost always a choice based on the history of his own campaign world. There is no game-related reason why most races can't have priests for any god, force or philosophy; but there are o
ften campaign-related reasons why a certain race can't belong to a certain priesthood.
\par \tab For example, if the halflings of a specific campaign world are pacifists, they'll be excluded from priesthood in the faith of the war-god. If dwarves are pragmatic, unr
omantic sorts who arrange all their marriages and don't conduct affairs of the heart, they'll be excluded from priesthood in the faith of the love-god.
\par \tab In the next chapter, we provide numerous examples of priesthoods of specific mythoi. With each, there's
 a recommendation for allowed races. These recommendations are based on the most common and popular conceptions of these races, and the DM is free to change them for his specific campaign.  
\par \tab Players beware: When the }{\i\fs24 Complete Priest's Handbook}{\fs24  says one thing about allowed races, and the DM says another, the DM is always right.
\par \tab  
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Experience and Spell Progression}{\fs24 
\par \tab 
\par \tab It would be possible to come up with an Experience Levels Chart and Spell Progression Chart for every priesthood of specific mythoi, but it would also be crazy; there's no reason to have the extra complication in your campaign.
\par \tab All new priesthoods introduced in the next chapter use the Cleric experience progression and the basic Priest spell progression, both from page 33 of the }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook}{\fs24 
. If your DM, when creating a new priesthood, decides that it is observably less powerful than the Cleric or the priesthoods written here, he can choose to use the Druid experience progression, which allows for faster acquisition of experience levels.

\par \tab  
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Gender Requirements}{\fs24 
\par \tab 
\par \tab In the worlds of the AD&D\'ae game, most priesthoods should allow both priests and priestesses. However, in fantasy worlds and the real world, some faiths have required that all their priesthood be of just one sex. If there is such a res
triction on a given priesthood, the DM will make note of it and tell the players.  
\par \tab  
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Nonweapon and Weapon Proficiencies}{\fs24 
\par \tab 
\par \tab Various priesthoods will require priests to know certain skills (nonweapon proficiencies) and be able to wield certain weapons (wea
pon proficiencies). For example, a priest of the god of Agriculture must know the Agriculture proficiency, while a priest of the god of Fire must know Fire-Building.
\par \tab Every priesthood should require one nonweapon proficiency of its priests and priestesses; it's a sign of their devotion. It's permissible, but not recommended, for them to require more than one.
\par \tab A priesthood }{\i\fs24 may }{\fs24 require one or more weapon proficiencies of its priests and priestesses, but we don't recommend this for most priesthoods. Many faiths allow their priests so few weapon choices anyway that it's pointless to}{
\i\fs24  require}{\fs24  they be taken. An exception is when a god is noted for wielding a specific weapon; for instance, it's quite reasonable to require Weapon Proficiency in War-Hammer for priest
s of the god Thor, whose principal weapon and symbol was the hammer.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Duties of the Priest}{\fs24 
\par \tab 
\par \tab Now, we get to a topic which adds a lot of color to the priesthood and the campaign world.
\par \tab All priesthoods have certain duties to perform, duties to the god and 
duties to the community or civilization. The DM needs to decide what each priesthood's duties are, and will often be able to use those duties to tie the priest character in to specific adventures and role-playing situations.
\par \tab Following are some sample ideas for priestly duties. The DM can use as few or as many of these as he wants when designing a new priesthood; he can also invent new ones to suit his campaign.
\par \tab  
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Devotions}{\fs24 
\par \tab 
\par \tab These are ordinary prayers and rituals which the priest conducts on a regular basis. They might include the saying of prayers at specific times of the day, upon observation of specific incidents or natural phenomena, and so forth.
\par \tab The DM can decide what these are and when they're undertaken, but the campaign shouldn't devote a lot of
 time to them; it's annoying and disconcerting to interrupt the adventure every so often so that the priests can pull out their holy symbols, kneel to the sun, and lead the faithful in prayer. Just knowing that they do this sort of thing on a regular basi
s is enough for most players.
\par \tab  
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Guidance
\par }{\fs24 \tab 
\par \tab In most civilizations, priests are supposed to act as counselors to everyone in need of advice. (This is one reason that Wisdom is a prime requisite.)
\par \tab Therefore, the priest character should not be surprised when
 he finds NPCs seeking him out and consulting him on troubling moral and ethical problems. These are good role-playing opportunities; they are often leads to specific adventures; and, with especially knotty problems, they can be difficult puzzles for the 
players to solve, all without using their swords and maces.
\par \tab Often, priests are posted to specific noble leaders in order to be their personal advisors. Naturally, this is only done when those noble leaders desire it, are willing to allow it, or (because of
 the priesthood's political strength) cannot afford to refuse it. This is a way to establish some sort of bond between new player-characters: The priest player-character could be assigned as advisor to the noble player-character.
\par \tab  
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Marriage}{\fs24 
\par \tab 
\par \tab In many human cultures, only the priest can perform marriages, so the DM may wish for this to be a duty of priests in his campaign.
\par \tab The DM will need to decide for his campaign whether or not marriages require the ministrations of priests, and might make a different 
choice for each sentient races. If humans require priests for marriage, do dwarves? (Perhaps they use advocates and notaries instead.) Do elves? (Perhaps their marriages are officiated by bards, who write songs commemorating the event as a sort of "marria
ge certificate.") Do halflings? (Perhaps they prefer ceremonies presided over by sheriffs or judges.)
\par \tab Also, the DM can always decide that priests of certain faiths cannot perform marriages. What, for example, does the god of weaponmaking have to do with marriage? On the other hand, it's equally appropriate for priests of }{\i\fs24 any}{\fs24 
 god to be able to perform marriages. This is especially true if, in the campaign, marriage constitutes permission or recognition from "higher forces," and any god, including those with attributes unrelated to marriage, may bless a marriage.  
\par \tab 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Missions}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab The duties of priesthood often involve going on missions important to the welfare of the god or the priesthood in general.
\par \tab One of the most common missions involves going somewhere and trying to convert the local population to worship of the priest's god. Usually, this involves religious education and what amount to social services; sometimes, it involves con
quering that culture and ruthlessly suppressing all signs of its old religion.
\par \tab Other, more exciting missions can involve recovery of artifacts, transportation of persons or goods (such as temple money) through dangerous territory, interpretation of phenomena in distant places, and holy war with the followers of another god.

\par \tab It's important for the DM to remember that the god himself isn't the only one who sends priests out on missions. For most missions, it's the upper ranks of the priesthood who do the as
signing, and priests are supposed to follow the orders of their superiors. So it's possible for any priesthood to have a "bad egg," a priest who issues orders which are contradictory to the tenets of the faith or designed to promote only his personal powe
r. This should, however, be a very rare campaign event, unless the campaign revolves around uncovering and purging a corrupt element of the sect.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Omen-Reading}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab In some campaigns, priests will be charged with the duty of reading omens for the future.
\par \tab If a campaign's priests have that duty, the DM has to decide how they do it, what it is they're actually doing, and who they're doing it for.  
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 How They Do It}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab Omen-Reading always requires some sort of ritual, usually a public one. 
\par \tab The priests ma
y sacrifice animals and examine their entrails for clues to the future. They may read tea-leaves. They may inhale dangerous fumes and prophesy while under their influence. They may listen to whispering in the trees, babbling of brooks, or the singing of b
irds and interpret that noise. They may enter meditative states and wait for inspiration from the gods. Each cult could do it a different way, and the DM can choose the method which he feels will add the most appropriate color to the cult in question.

\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 
\par What They're Doing}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab Then, the DM has to figure out what it is the priests are actually doing when prophesying. Here are some choices:
\par \tab  }{\b\fs24 They're Receiving the Word of Their God:}{\fs24  The priests are actually receiving some inspiration from their deity. Naturally,
 such omens are usually clouded in imprecise terminology and symbolism, so that it's easy for the recipient of an omen to misinterpret the results.
\par \tab  }{\b\fs24 They're Following Ritual Interpretation:}{\fs24  The priests have a set of techniques of interpretation which they
 follow rigidly. These techniques may or may not have any basis in campaign reality; they might have been granted by the god, or created through ignorance.
\par \tab  }{\b\fs24 They're Analyzing Based On Their Knowledge:}{\fs24  The priests aren't actually prophesying at all, but su
pplying answers based on their understanding of the situation and of the ways of the world. If they are then pretending that their answers come from a higher source, they are obviously being dishonest; only a corrupt branch of a priesthood will do this. H
owever, it's possible for such a method to be very accurate, especially if it concerns itself mostly with questions of warfare and human  nature.
\par \tab  }{\b\fs24 They're Telling the Audience What It Wants to Hear:}{\fs24  The priests are acting primarily as cheerleaders and tell
ing the people precisely what they want to hear: That they'll win the war, they're always right, they've done no wrong, love conquers all. Again, priests acting in this manner are being dishonest to their flocks, but it will often be difficult to convince
 the flocks of that.
\par \tab  }{\b\fs24 They're Working for Gain:}{\fs24  Some very corrupt sects or branches of sects manipulate their answers to gain in power or money. This usually takes one of two methods. 
\par \tab   In the first, the priests supply answers which favor their purposes.
 If representatives of one city ask, "When we attack our enemies, will we prevail?" the priests then decide whom they want to win that war. If they want the attackers to win, they answer "Yes." Then, the attackers will be encouraged by the reply, and the 
defenders discouraged, which weighs the war in the attackers' favor. If they want the defenders to win, they answer "No," with precisely the opposite effect; the discouraged attackers might not even launch the attack.
\par \tab 
In the second, the priests accept bribes in order to put their god's stamp of approval on the activities of certain men. For instance, a king might secretly pay the priests a lavish amount, then publicly approach the oracle and ask, "Shall I not execute t
h
e traitor so-and-so now without benefit of trial?" or "Should I marry so-and-so against her wishes?" or any other such question. The answer he receives, of course, will be the one he paid to get, and because the god has "made his wishes known," the citize
ns will probably not dispute the choice.  
\par \tab In both these approaches, the god may eventually notice that one branch of his priesthood is corrupt, and set about correcting matters, either through his own intervention or by alerting other branches of the prie
sthood. On the other hand, a particularly disinterested god might never notice.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 But Are They Right?
\par }{\fs24 \tab  
\par \tab As part of deciding what they're doing, the DM has to decide how often they're right. 
\par \tab The priests will often be right if they're receiving the word of their god; this word may be misinterpreted, but it's always }{\i\fs24 correct}{\fs24 . 
\par \tab They could have any sort of accuracy the DM decides if they're following some pattern of ritual interpretation; perhaps the ritual is effective, perhaps it is not.
\par \tab If they're anal
yzing the situation based on their current knowledge, then their accuracy depends mostly in their interpretive abilities; a priesthood might have enough knowledge of the world and human nature to be able to supply consistently-correct answers to supplican
ts.
\par \tab 
  If they're telling the audience what it wants to hear, they could be very accurate for a time, especially if they're prophesying for a warlike state which is on the rise and mostly asking about upcoming victories. Eventually, however, the tides of fa
te will turn and the prophecies will become unreliable, which will disillusion the populace.  
\par \tab If they're working for gain, they could be very successful for quite a while. Eventually, though, the scandal will break, and the population will learn the truth . . . which could be very bad for those greedy prophets.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 Who It's For
\par }{\fs24 \tab  
\par \tab Finally, the DM has to decide who is able to receive these prophecies. Here are some typical choices:
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Anyone:}{\fs24  Anyone who asks a question will receive some sort of reply.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Anyone With the Means:}{\fs24 
 Some temples require a sacrifice of animals or wealth in order for the supplicant to receive a prophecy. (This isn't necessarily a sign of corruption; it's often just a means of ensuring the temple's upkeep and the faith's continuing sec
ular, or worldly, power.)
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Nobles Only:}{\fs24  In this arrangement, only members of noble houses can ask questions of the oracle.
\par \tab The DM can also make more peculiar choices for specific oracles. An oracle might only be for slaves, for adventurers, for people who
 have at least once travelled to a specific holy site, for people of specific alignments, for members of one race, etc.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Vigilance}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab Finally, priests have to be vigilant against powers or elements which threaten their faith or their followers.
\par \tab These powers and elements don't usually take the direct approach, such as attacks by armies or monsters. The priest needs to be vigilant against more subtle intrusions, including:
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 The Agent Provocateur:}{\fs24  This is someone who falsely joins the priesthood, spends a
 long time becoming a trusted member or even a leader of it, and then persuades members of the faith to perform actions which will get the faith into trouble. For example, in times when the priesthood is in conflict with another faith, the Agent Provocate
u
r might encourage outright war with that faith. When a conflict with the local rulers could be sorted out by calm diplomacy, the Agent Provocateur will instead recommend or issue ultimatums and demands. And, naturally, the Agent will keep his true masters
 apprised of the priesthood's secret movements and activities at all times.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Corruption in Specific Orders:}{\fs24  Sometimes priests go bad and use the priesthood for their own gain. In addition to methods mentioned above, they may also secretly defy requirements 
of their priesthood, steal temple funds, use their duties of guidance to influence others to profit these priests, etc. No such corruption goes unnoticed forever, but the unwillingness of people to believe that they've put their faith in crooks and thieve
s can ensure that this corruption can go on for a long, long time.  
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Libels:}{\fs24  At times, members of rival priesthoods will persuade their followers that other priesthoods perform acts which are profane and evil. In a culture where religious prejudice is a st
rong factor, this is often easy to do. For instance, it might prove simple to convince one's flock that the priests of a more despised faith are kidnapping young women (only women of the libeller's faith, of course) to serve as unwilling temple concubines
,
 then killing them. It's especially easy to do when the libeller secretly arranges for the kidnapping and murder of several young women in his own faith. When this sort of thing goes on, it's vital that the priests of the accused faith prove the truth. Th
e
y can't do it just by giving local authorities a tour of their temple to show there are no unwilling concubines here -- and even if they do, a particularly clever enemy will have concealed the body of one of the kidnapped girls there for the authorities t
o find! It requires capture of the killers and demonstration that they were serving someone else . . . all of which is a good basis for a priest-oriented adventure.
\par \tab Obviously, it's the duty of faithful priests to combat all these situations these when they're noticed. However, it's a characteristic of the greatest priest-heroes to notice these trends }{\i\fs24 well ahead of the time that they become critical}{
\fs24  , and to deal with them early in their development, before they can result in serious harm to the priesthood.
\par \tab 
For the DM, this is a good way to give the PC priest an opportunity for rapid advancement in his priesthood: If he's the first to notice such a trend and is able to spearhead the movement to correct it, he will be well-regarded by his peers. This is also 
a good way to establish that an NPC priest is a hero of his faith, if he, in the past, has thwarted such situations.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Rights of the Priesthood}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab  At the DM's discretion, priesthoods can have special rights and powers, too. These rights usually depend on
 the amount of influence the priesthood wields in the campaign setting; a minor priesthood may not enjoy any of these benefits, while a dominant one could have all of them.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Church Trial}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab In some cultures, the secular (non-priestly) authorities canno
t put priests on trial for any sort of crime. That doesn't mean a priest can perform a crime and laugh at the law, however: Most priestly orders police themselves, and will try (or punish without trial) transgressions.
\par \tab Priestly orders don't ordinarily fla
unt this power in order to defy secular authorities. When priests commit crimes, priesthoods usually punish them. Exceptions occur when the priest was acting at the priesthood's behest, particularly when the god requires actions which are against the law 
of the land. In these cases, the priest sometimes goes unpunished; sometimes he receives a "slap on the wrist" punishment to quiet the secular authorities.
\par \tab The DM, not the player, gets to decide whether priests have the right to church trial.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Coronation
\par }{\fs24 \tab  
\par \tab The most powerful priesthood in a given land will probably have the right to crown kings when they ascend the throne. The DM has to decide whether this is merely an honor bestowed on the priesthood, or whether it is a right which the priesthood can u
se to influence the throne.
\par \tab If it's the former, then the chief priest is accorded the right to officiate at the coronation ceremony. However, if the priest refused to officiate, the crowning will take place anyway; the king can choose another priesthood f
or the honor, or he can be crowned without the priesthood's sanction.
\par \tab If it's the latter, then the priesthood can deny someone the right to take the throne by refusing to crown him. This is a very powerful right, and through it the priesthood can exert considerable influence on the nation.
\par \tab That's not to say that, by refusing to crown a certain candidate, the priesthood can stage a bloodless coup and choose the king. 
\par \tab Let's assume a priesthood does such a thing and refuses the chief candidate for the throne, then spreads the word they will support a certain other candidate.
\par \tab The refused candidate may decide to mount a war against the priesthood. The new candidate, if crowned, may find that none of the other nobles in the nation support his kingship. All of
 this can result in a bloody civil war which could tear the nation apart and wreck the priesthood's power.
\par \tab Therefore, when the priesthood decides to exercise this power, it does tend to make compromises, to negotiate secretly with the parties involved, to
 plan things carefully so that trouble is kept to a minimum. Only the most arrogant of priesthoods would try to take for itself the full right to choose the king . . .  and such priesthoods are likely to lead their nation into war or chaos.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Other Confirmations}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab It could be that confirmations other than coronation are the special province of one priesthood. For example, in one nation, any priest might perform marriages for commoners, but only the priests of a specific god might perform marriages for nobles.

\par \tab This would give that priesthood great power, because by collectively deciding or refusing to marry certain couples, this priesthood has the power to influence which families unite and which do not.  
\par \tab Again, abuse of this right could lead to harm, but careful application of it would allow the priesthood to affect the growth and development of the nation.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Tithes}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab Some priesthoods, the most powerful ones in a culture, are able to demand }{\i\fs24 tithes}{\fs24 
 of their followers. A tithe is an amount of money, often represented as a fraction of the money-earner's regular wage, which the follower is required to pay to the priesthood. Theoretically, it is used for upkeep of churches and temples, purchase of supp
lies and equipment for the priests, etc. Some priesthoods also use these moneys for influence with the government; a very few corrupt priests dip into it for personal gain.
\par \tab In an AD&D\'ae game campaign, only the religion of a monotheistic state, or the state religion, will be able legally to demand tithes of its followers. Such tithes will usually run from 5% to 15% of the character's income, with 10% being most common.

\par \tab Priesthoods of other faiths will ask their followers to tithe a like amount. Naturally, not all their followers will tithe and so such religions bring in less tithed income than those who can demand it.
\par \tab Player-character priests don't get to see that money; it is recorded by church accountants, stored in church treasures, and distributed or spent by superior priests.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Separation from the Faith}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab Some priesthoods can exert considerable influence on their followers by being able to separate them from the faith. If, for instance, all followers are promised a certain role in the afterlife, and 
separation from the faith would deny them that role (and replace it with something far more frightening or ghastly), then the followers of the faith are likely to obey the priesthood.
\par \tab Naturally, most priesthoods visit this punishment only on those followe
rs who most flagrantly defy the requirements of the faith. Just as naturally, the occasional corrupt priest would threaten followers with this punishment unless they are blindly, absolutely obedient to him.
\par \tab However, this punishment doesn't work so well in
 a culture which worships many gods and which has a separate, independent priesthood for each god. If you threaten a follower of the war-god with separation, he might be just as happy to switch over to worship of the sea-god. This is a balancing factor wh
ich helps keep down abuse of this right in many cultures. However, monotheistic cultures (those which worship only one god) don't have this balancing factor; they have to rely on the honesty of the priesthood.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Rule}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab Some cultures are }{\i\fs24 theocracies}{\fs24  , wh
ich means they are ruled by their priestly classes. Naturally, in such a culture, one priesthood will be dominant; the culture may worship only one god, or may tolerate other worships but be mainly devoted to one specific god.
\par \tab In a theocracy, the nation m
ay be ruled by a board of priests from the state religion, but it's more common for it to be ruled by a single king who is also a priest and the head of his priesthood. Such an arrangement may be benevolent, with a wise cleric ruling the land; or it may b
e particularly nasty, with a power-mad priest or the priest of an evil god in charge.
\par \tab Many "lost worlds" (i.e., nations hidden away from the rest of the world, secluded in a lost valley or cavern or other distant place) are theocracies ruled by evil priest
s; adventurer-heroes stumbling into such cultures often find themselves having to stir up revolution and cast down these rulers so that justice can return to these lands.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 The State Religion}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab For any culture, the DM will have to decide if there is a State Religion. The State Religion is the official faith of the nation, as sanctioned by the government.
\par \tab Its priesthood will have the following rights: Right to church trial, right to coronation (t
hough not necessarily the right to deny coronation to the chief candidate), right to demand tithes. If the culture is monotheistic, the State Religion will also have the right to separate offenders from the faith. The DM can assign other rights to the Sta
te Religion as he sees fit.
\par \tab State Religions are not limited to big nations. Any independent city or city-state could have its own state religion. Thus, cities mere miles apart might have different state religions. This could cause trouble if both are monot
heistic, or both belong to enemy priesthoods; on the other hand, the priesthoods could be neutral or friendly to one another, causing no such trouble.
\par \tab However, a nation does not have to have a state religion. In fact, the most powerful faith in a nation will not necessarily be a state religion; it will just exert considerable influence.  
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Restrictions on the Priest}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab Priesthoods are also restricted, usually by decree of the god himself. Below are examples of many typical sorts of restrictions: Note that most priesthoods will only have a }{\i\fs24 few }{\fs24 
of these restrictions, and each faith may employ different ones.
\par \tab Gods make these requirements of their priesthoods for four principal reasons: Commemoration, Function, Philosophy, and Sacrifice.  
\par \tab }{\i\fs24 Commemoration}{\fs24  means that the action is a reminder of some important event from the history of the faith. For example, the cross and crucifix are symbols of the Crucifixion.
\par \tab }{\i\fs24 Function}{\fs24  means that if the requirement is not met, the priest cannot for some reason function as a priest. For instance, if, in a specific campaign world, clerical magic will not work if the caster has consumed alcohol
, then the priesthood will have a requirement that its priests not drink.
\par \tab }{\i\fs24 Philosophy}{\fs24  means that the choice is bound up with other elements of the faith. If certain creatures are held to be unholy, unclean, or otherwise taboo, for instance, there will be m
any secondary requirements derived from that thought. A priest wouldn't be able to wear armor made from its hide or eat its meat. To be buried in or with its skin might even result in involuntary separation from the faith!  
\par \tab }{\i\fs24 Sacrifice }{\fs24 means that the god requires this behavior to test the mettle of his followers. Those who can't make the sacrifice are obviously not cut out to be his priests.
\par \tab At his discretion, the DM can make any of these requirements apply to the worshippers of the god in addition to the priesthood. Especially appropriate are restrictions involving Contamination (see below).  
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Armor}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab Priests may be limited in the types of armor they wear. Some sample limitations:
\par \tab   
\par \tab May not wear non-metal armor
\par \tab May not wear metal armor
\par \tab May not wear magical armor
\par \tab May not wear }{\i\fs24 any}{\fs24  armor
\par \tab May not use shields
\par \tab May not use certain types of shields
\par \tab May only wear armor made by priests of the same faith
\par \tab   
\par \tab Any of these restrictions could be made for any of the four reasons given above. If metal armor
 disrupts clerical magic, then it could not be worn by priests. If the religion's philosophy forbids harm to animals, then leather armor may be forbidden. And so on.
\par \tab Armor restrictions don't just reflect the god's attributes or prohibitions; they help define the combat roles of priests in the campaign. A priest who can wear full metal armor is more likely to be a combat force in the campaign than one who can't.

\par \tab You can be more sure that a player who picks a priest-type which is limited to less efficient armor is a player who wants to role-play a priest, rather than one who merely wants to play a fighting machine who is efficient in both combat and magic.

\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Celibacy}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab Though in modern times the terms Celibacy and Chastity have become confused, here we'r
e only using the older meaning of the word Celibacy: The state of being unmarried. Priests who are required to be celibate must remain unmarried. A DM must decide individually for each celibate priesthood if its priests must also remain chaste (see below)
.
\par \tab 
A priesthood could require celibacy as a sacrifice to the god, because it was philosophically opposed to the state of marriage, or for many other reasons. The fighting priesthood of a war-god might require its priests to stay celibate so that they won't 
be distracted by thoughts of home and family while engaged in warfare.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Chastity}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab Chastity involves not engaging in sexual relations. A priest could be celibate but not chaste; one could even be chaste but not celibate, though that would be pretty strange.
\par \tab Priesthoods require chastity as a sacrifice to the god, or when its priests are supposed in some way to be spouses of the god (either in a symbolic or genuine sense).
\par \tab In some faiths, chastity is required of its priests except for during specific events or times of the year. For instance, priests of an agricultural deity might be requ
ired to remain chaste except during the planting season, when chastity is revoked in order to magically "encourage" the fertility of the fields.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Clothing
\par }{\fs24 \tab  
\par \tab Priests are often required to wear distinctive costumes proclaiming their status. They may only have to do so during the performance of their official functions, or might have to wear their priestly vestments during all waking hours.
\par \tab Such items don't have to be full costumes. A priest might be only required to wear the specific holy symbol of his faith; otherwise, he could wear what he wished.
\par \tab   In some faiths, priests cannot wear certain types of clothing. Historically, some priest-kings of earth-goddess were forbidden to wear clothes with knots in them; if they wore textile garments, they had to have ragged, unknotted hems.  
\par \tab   Priests might also be required to conceal certain parts of their bodies by clothing. Beyond restrictions imposed by society for modesty's sake, priests might have to conceal other parts not considered immodest by the general population.  
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Contamination
\par }{\fs24 \tab  
\par \tab Many faiths regard certain items or substances as unholy, unclean, or taboo. Its priests are not permitted to handle such things. If they come in contact with them accidentally, they must undergo holy rituals of puri
fications to cleanse themselves of the taint.
\par \tab Some sample items or substances include:
\par \tab   
\par \tab Animals (specific animals or whole classes of animals)
\par \tab Blood
\par \tab Gems or Jewels (specific types)
\par \tab Iron
\par \tab Plants (specific plants or whole classes of plants)
\par \tab Water (from specific bodies of water)
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Hit Points}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab   Clerics and Druids receive 8-sided dice for hit point progression (see}{\i\fs24  Player'sHandbook}{\fs24 , Chapter Two). The cler
ic does a lot of fighting, and the druid has a very demanding existence, living as he does in the wilderness; both need to have comparatively high hit point totals.  
\par \tab The DM can, if he wishes, make any priesthood of a specific mythos take six-sided dice for hit points (like rogues) or even four-sided dice (like wizards). But this is only appropriate for priestly orders which are not very demanding physically.

\par \tab Most priesthoods should have eight-sided dice for hit points. If a DM decides that a priesthood w
ill have less robust dice, then he must compensate the priesthood with enhanced access to spells and (especially) numerous Granted Powers (discussed below).
\par \tab  }{\i\fs24 A priesthood should only receive six-sided dice}{\fs24  if it has medium to poor combat abilities, and belongs to a deity with very few physical demands.
\par \tab For example, a god of dawn has no intrinsic orientation toward combat, and "dawn" does not imply any specific physical demands.
\par \tab  }{\i\fs24 A priesthood should only receive four-sided dice}{\fs24  if it has poor combat abilities, and belongs to a deity whose attribute implies soft living.
\par \tab For example, a god of peace or love could have priests with little or no combat abilities and with four-sided dice. However, it's}{\i\fs24  important}{\fs24  to note that this does not }{\i\fs24 have}{\fs24  to be the case . 
. . It is only the case when the DM insists upon it. Priests of the god of peace could be pacifists, but still be good at combat . . . which they may only employ in self-defense. A god of love noted for weapons use, as Eros was noted for his archery, coul
d have priests who specialized in that weapon, and would}{\i\fs24  not}{\fs24  have to be stuck with a measly 1d4 for hit points.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Magical Items}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab Priests are already limited to using magical items usable by all classes or by priests only. But they might also be further restricted by their faiths.
\par \tab For example, priests of a specific faith might be required to use only magical items made by priests of their order, or might be required to use no magical items whatsoever.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Mutilation}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab Occasionally, a priesthood will demand a sacrifice of mutilation of its priesthood. This is most common among evil priesthoods, but could theoretically occur with any priesthood, regardless of alignment.  
\par \tab For example, devotees of a blind god of prophecy might be forced to blind themselves. (However, it would be more appropriate for them merely to have a Clothing restriction that required them to wear blindfolds when performing official duties.)
\par \tab When this sort of thing does take place, the priesthood is often compensated for its loss: Th
e god often grants them an extra power (as described below, under "Powers of the Priest"). A priesthood required to be blind, for example, might have an extra power of analysis, identification or prophecy.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Weapons}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab Many priesthoods require their priests to use only a certain category of weapons. Some only restrict them }{\i\fs24 from}{\fs24 
 using a certain narrow category of weapons. Some require their priests to use no weapons at all. Commonly, a god identified with a certain type of weapon will require his priests to use that weapon and a certain number of similar or related weapons.  

\par \tab The DM should assign the priesthood a weapons restriction based on two choices.
\par \tab First, weapons restrictions reinforce the special attributes and character of the worshipped god; limiting priests of the god of Death to sickle-like weapons certainly establishes flavor for them.
\par \tab Second, weapons restrictions, like armor restrictions, help define the combat roles of priests in the campaign. If a priest is limited to daggers and creampuff
s, he's not going to be the campaign's combat monster, so magic and his priestly duties will be much more important to the character.
\par \tab Many examples of this are given in the next chapter, "Sample Priesthoods."
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Spheres of Influence}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab As you'll recall (from the }{\b\fs24 DMG}{\fs24 , pages 33, 34), priest spells are divided into categories called }{\i\fs24 spheres of influence.}{\fs24  Each spell belongs to one of 16 categories. Those categories include:
\par \tab All, Animal, Astral, Charm, Combat, Creation, Divination, Elemental, Guardian, Healing, Necromantic, Plant, Protection, Summoning, Sun, and Weather.
\par \tab Priests can't cast spells from all spheres of influence. Any specific priesthood can have }{\i\fs24 major access}{\fs24  to one or several spheres, and thus eventually learn to cast spells of any level from that sphere, and can have }{\i\fs24 
minor access}{\fs24  to one or several other spheres, and learn to cast spells from only 1st through 3rd level in that sphere.
\par \tab When designing a new priesthood, the DM decides which spheres of influence the priesthood has.
\par \tab All priesthoods should have major access to the All sphere. Beyond that, the DM should choose a number of spheres, and the access to each, based on the attributes of the god being served, and on how combat-efficient the priest is already. 
\par \tab If a priestho
od currently has access to good armor and a wide range of weapons, the DM should limit the range of spells available to them. If, however, the priests do not have access to mighty engines of war, the DM may want them to have a greater ability with magic, 
reflected by access to more spheres, and major access to a greater proportion of them.
\par \tab Priests should have Major access to just about any sphere that has any bearing on the primary attribute of their god, and at least Minor access to spheres which have a l
esser relationship to their god. (For instance, priests of a God of War who is noted for his protectiveness might have minor, or even major, access to the Guardian and Protection spheres.)
\par \tab Here are some rules of thumb to go by when assigning Spheres of Influence to specific priesthoods:
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 The Priesthood Has Good Combat Abilities}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab If a priesthood is allowed to use metal armors and a good range of weapons, we consider that it has good combat abilities. Therefore, it should have less effective magic, including:
\par 
\par \tab }{\i\fs24  Major Access To:}{\fs24  The "All" Sphere, and two other Spheres.
\par \tab }{\i\fs24  Minor Access To:}{\fs24  Two Spheres.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 The Priesthood Has Medium Combat Abilities}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab If a priesthood is allowed to use metal armors but restricted to a poor range of weapons, or is not allo
wed to use metal armors but has access to a good range of weapons, we consider that it has medium combat abilities. It should have a more average access to magic, including:
\par 
\par \tab  }{\i\fs24 Major Access To:}{\fs24  The "All" Sphere, and four other Spheres.
\par \tab }{\i\fs24  Minor Access To:}{\fs24  Four Spheres.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 The Priesthood Has Poor Combat Abilities}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab   If the priesthood is not allowed to use metal armors (or even}{\i\fs24  any}{\fs24  armors) and has access to a poor range of weapons, we say that it has poor combat abilities. It should have an enhanced access to magic, including:  
\par 
\par \tab  }{\i\fs24 Major Access To:}{\fs24  The "All" Sphere, and six other Spheres.
\par \tab  }{\i\fs24 Minor Access To:}{\fs24  Six Spheres.
\par \tab  
\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 Some Definitions}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab "A good range of weapons" is not a
 very precise definition, but it's harder to be more precise; what is and is not considered a good range varies with each individual DM. In general, if the priesthood is allowed access to five or more different types of weapons (a bow isn't that different
 from a crossbow for our purposes, but a mace is different from a spear), or if the priesthood is limited to a few efficient and high-damage (1d8 and better) weapons (such as swords), we say that it has a }{\i\fs24 good }{\fs24 range of available weapons.

\par \tab "A poor range of weapons" is just as imprecise. In general, if the priesthood is allowed access to four or fewer different types of weapons, or has access to a greater number of weapons which do no more than 1d6+1 damage, we say that it has a }{
\i\fs24 poor }{\fs24 range of available weapons.
\par \tab 
If a priesthood doesn't allow the priest access to the full number of spheres appropriate to that type of priesthood, then the DM should supplement the priesthood with extra Granted Powers. For instance, if a priesthood has Good Combat Abilities but is 
designed with major access to the All sphere and }{\i\fs24 only }{\fs24 one other sphere, and minor access to two spheres, then the priesthood is receiving less abilities than it should; it should be given some minor Granted Power to compensate.
\par \tab   
\par \tab   Now, this valiant eff
ort to keep combat abilities and magical abilities balanced is substantially thwarted by the original Cleric class himself. The Cleric has major access to 12 Spheres, minor access to one, and the ability to wear metal armors. In short, he is more powerful
 than just about any more restrictive priesthood.
\par \tab   If the players in a campaign are likely not to take priests of specific mythoi simply because the original Cleric class is more powerful, the DM may wish to revise the Cleric in his campaign. For more on 
this, see "Toning Down the Cleric" in the Role-Playing chapter.  
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Granted Powers}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab Many types of priests also have special Granted Powers. The basic Cleric, for instance, can turn undead. The Druid starts out with bonuses to specific saving throws an
d speaks an additional specific language, and gains other granted powers as he gains in levels.
\par \tab The DM should add at least one Granted Power to the abilities of a priest of a specific mythos; this gives the priest more individual flavor and character. The DM could add several, if this specific priest-class is weak compared to other priests.

\par \tab Additionally, as with the Druid, the DM can arrange things so that the priest acquires new Granted Powers at certain experience levels, instead of receiving all of them at first level.
\par \tab Granted Powers come in three levels: High Powers, Medium Powers, and Low Powers.
\par \tab As with all the priest's special abilities, Granted Powers should be chosen for the priest based on the attributes of the worshipped god. It's not inapprop
riate to give a water-breathing ability to the priest of an ocean-god, but is quite inappropriate for the priest of a god of the desert winds.
\par \tab Some Granted Powers may be used any time the priest wishes and when circumstances allow. For example, normal cle
rics can try to Turn Undead as many times in a day as they wish (but it can only work when they're facing undead, naturally). Other Granted Powers may only be used a certain number of times per day. When the DM first adds a Granted Power to the listing of
 a priest's abilities, he must define how often and under what conditions the Granted Power may work.
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 
\par High Powers}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab High Powers are those which are of great use in situations which arise frequently in the campaign. Here are some examples of High Powers appropriate to various types of priests:
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 Charm/Fascination}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab This power works just like the third-level Wizard spell }{\i\fs24 suggestion}{\fs24 , except that the priest does not have to use material components to the spell.
\par \tab The DM may define
 this Power as working one of two ways. Either it can be used in combat (in which case it can be used against only one target at a time), or it cannot be used in combat (in which it can be used against a number of targets equal in HD to two times the Prie
st's experience level).
\par \tab In either case, the Priest can use the ability three times per day. If the target makes his saving throw, he may choose to reject the suggestion, but will not recognize that priestly magic was being used against him.
\par \tab This power is most appropriate to priests of the gods of love, mischief and trickery, music, and peace, but can be given to any priesthood which has an influential position in the society.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 Immunities}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab This power gives the priest an automatically-successful saving throw against certain types of damage, attacks, or broad classes of spells.
\par \tab Examples of appropriate categories for immunity: 
\par \tab Certain types of priests might have automatically successful saves against }{\b\fs24 all Evocation spells.}{\fs24  This is a very powerful abilit
y; it means the priest will automatically take half damage from most damaging spells. (Those spells which don't allow a saving throw are not stopped or affected by this immunity.)
\par \tab Others might have automatic success against all }{\b\fs24 Enchantment/Charm spells.}{\fs24  T
his is equally powerful; it means that the priest will be completely unaffected by most spells of this sort, as well as other powers such as the vampire's hypnotic gaze.
\par \tab Immunities may be taken against any one wizardly }{\b\fs24 School of Magic,}{\fs24  against any one priestly }{\b\fs24 Sphere of Influence,}{\fs24  or against all }{\b\fs24 Poisons,}{\fs24 
 as a High Power. There are other, lesser, immunities, discussed below.
\par \tab Immunities can work }{\i\fs24 against}{\fs24  a character, though. Immunity to }{\b\fs24 all priestly Necromantic spells}{\fs24  means that the character does not benefi
t as much from Healing spells. He automatically makes his saving throw against them, whether he wishes to or not, and so gets only half the healing value of the spell.
\par \tab The Immunity must be appropriate to the attributes of the god being served. The priest of a god of healing might have an Immunity to all poisons, while the priest of the god of love might have an Immunity to Enchantment/Charm spells.
\par \tab The most important thing to remember about Immunity is that it isn't complete protection. It merely gives the character an automatically-successful Saving Throw. In most cases, this means that he will still take half damage from the attack or spell.

\par \tab There is no limit on the number of times per day a character can use this ability; whenever he is struck with the appropriate attack, his Immunity helps protect him.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 Inspire Fear}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab This power is similar to the wizard's fourth-level }{\i\fs24 fear}{\fs24  spell, though the cleric does not have to use material components.
\par \tab A priest with this power can use it twice per day.
\par \tab This power is most appropriate to priests of gods with dark or fearsome aspects: Death, for example.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 Shapechanging}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab This power is very similar to the druid's shapechanging Granted Power, not to the ninth-level wizard spell; read the description of that power in the }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook.}{\fs24 
\par \tab The power can be used three times per day; it is the DM's decision whether the priest can change into three different types of animal, each once per day, or only into one specific type of animal three times per day.
\par \tab This pow
er, though it would seem to be most appropriate to priests of gods of nature, is actually appropriate for any priesthood . . . if the god in question has an animal symbol or totem. For instance, if the god of the sky has as his symbol the eagle, it's appr
opriate for his priests to have this power and turn into an eagle three times per day.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 Turning Undead}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab This is identical to the cleric's ability. It is most appropriate to priests of the g
ods of birth, dawn, fertility, fire, good, guardianship, healing, light, love, magic, and the sun. There is no limit to the number of times per day a priest can use this ability.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Medium Powers}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab Medium Powers are those which are of some usefulness in situations which arise frequently in the campaign, or are of great use in situations which only arise occasionally. Here are some examples of Medium Powers:
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 Defiance of Restriction or Obstacle}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab With this power, the priest can simply ignore some aspect of the physical world which normally slows, impedes, or prevents passage.
\par \tab For example:
\par \tab The priest of a nature god might be able to ignore heavy underbrush: He can travel through the thickest undergrowth as fast as he could normally walk, while other humans are slowed or even stopped completely.
\par \tab The priest of the god of winter or the north wind might not find ice slippery; he could move at a normal rate across the slipperiest frozen rivers or glaciers with no chance of falling.
\par \tab The priest of a god of wind might be able to walk into the fiercest headwind without being slowed.
\par \tab The priest of the god of mischief might be able to climb walls and hillsides at his normal walking-speed, and without the need to make a roll for success.
\par \tab There is no limit to the number of times per day a priest can use this ability.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 Immunities}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab You read about Immunities above, under "High Powers." The Medium Powers immunities are not so strong. A single immunity will give a priest an automatically-successful saving throw against:
\par \tab A narrow category of spells (for example, all Fire spells of the Evocation school);
\par \tab A narrow category of special powers (all Paralysis, including Hold spells and ghoulish paralysis; or all Energy Drains; or all dragon-breath powers); or
\par \tab A narrow category of poisons (all snake venoms, for example).
\par \tab Again, each type of Immunity is appropriate to a different type of priest. Priests of the god of Fire could be immune to Fire spells. Priests of the god of Earth, whose symbol is often the snake, could be immune to all snake venoms.
\par \tab And, again, Immunity isn't complete protection; it just gives the character an automatically-successful Saving Throw.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 Incite Berserker Rage}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab This power allows a priest to inspire a fighter (anyone belonging to the warrior class) to a state like berserker rage. The warrior must be willing to have this war-blessing bestowed upon him.
\par \tab It takes one round for a priest to incite a single warrior to 
berserker rage; the rage last six turns. A priest can use this power on any number of warriors per day, one at a time. A warrior may only be incited to berserker rage once per day; even if a different priest tries it on him, it cannot incite a warrior to 
a second rage in the same day.
\par \tab   The rage isn't identical to the abilities of the true berserker (see the description for the berserker in }{\i\fs24 The Complete Fighter's Handbook).}{\fs24  However, it does give the warrior a +2 to hit and damage for the duration of the ra
ge. While enraged, the warrior cannot flee from a fight; he cannot leave the field of battle until no enemies face him. Once he does leave the field of battle, he can choose whether or not he will emerge from the rage or sustain it; a warrior would sustai
n it if he felt that another fight was likely to take place soon. When he emerges from the rage, the warrior takes no extra damage or ill effects.  
\par \tab This power is most appropriate to priests of the god of war.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 Language and Communication}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab The priest with this power gains one extra language}{\i\fs24  per experience}{\fs24  }{\i\fs24 level }{\fs24 
he gains. This power is often granted only after a certain experience level is attained; for example, with the druid, this power is granted at 3rd level.
\par \tab If nonweapon proficiency rules are used, then the priest gains one }{\i\fs24 extra}{\fs24  nonweapon proficiency slot each level, and must use that slot to acquire a language.
\par \tab The types of languages learned with this power should be restricted by the DM. Priests of the gods of nature are limited to learning the
 languages of woodland creatures, while priests of the gods of the earth are limited to learning the languages of serpents, dragons, and other cthonian reptiles; priests of the gods of the sky are limited to the languages of birds and other aerial creatur
es, while priests of the gods of the seas are limited to the languages of sea-dwelling creatures.
\par \tab The number of languages learned with this power may likewise be limited. Six to ten extra languages learned this way is a practical limit.
\par \tab If the campaign is
 using the optional weapon and nonweapon proficiency rules, then priests might, instead of being limited to languages, receive proficiency slots limited to certain categories of languages, weapon proficiencies, and nonweapon proficiencies pertinent to the
ir faith.
\par \tab  }{\i\fs24 Example:}{\fs24  The priest of a specific war-god might, at third level, start receiving one extra weapon proficiency slot every experience level up to 12th.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 Laying On of Hands}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab This power is identical to the paladin's ability; the priest can, once per day, heal himself or another for 2 hit points per experience level.
\par \tab This constitutes a little extra healing ability. It's most appropriate to priests of the god of healing. It's also appropriate to priests who don't have access to healing spells, but who should have a little bit of healing ability anyway.
\par \tab A }{\i\fs24 reversed}{\fs24  version of the power, where the priest lays on his hands and inflicts 2 points of damage per experience level, or 1 point of damage per level if the victim makes a saving throw, is appr
opriate for priests of the god of disease. A priest cannot have a healing Laying On of Hands that is also }{\i\fs24 reversible}{\fs24  to a harmful Laying On of Hands; it must be defined as either healing or harmful.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 Prophecy}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab With this power, the priest can sometimes see visions of the future. A priest with the Prophecy power can use it two different ways.
\par \tab First, the priest may sink into a meditative trance and try to receive visions of the future. This trance lasts ten turns; if the priest is interrupted before the
 ten turns are done (struck with a weapon, shouted at by someone within six feet of him, or knocked over), the trance is prematurely broken and the priest gets no vision.
\par \tab Second, visions may just come to the priest, at the DM's discretion. When the priest is hit with such a vision, for a single combat round he no longer perceives the real world; he sees, hears and experiences nothing but his vision.
\par \tab The priest receives no vision of the future if the DM doesn't have one for him to see. Therefore, the pries
t who deliberately sinks into a receptive trance gets absolutely no vision if the DM doesn't want him to see one. Therefore, this power is only partly an ability which gives the priest an advantage of future sight; it's primarily a tool for the DM to give
 the priest clues about the future, clues which guide the adventure without giving the priest an overwhelming advantage in the campaign.
\par \tab The visions which the priest receives should be short and easy to misinterpret. They may be highly symbolic; if he sees
 a rat fighting a serpent to the death, the animals may represent mighty armies which bear those creatures on their flags, or may represent two characters with traits similar to those animals.
\par \tab Also, the DM must decide whether, in his campaign, prophetic visions are }{\i\fs24 changeable}{\fs24  or }{\i\fs24 unchangeable.}{\fs24 
 If they're changeable, then the priest will sometimes see events which can be prevented. This tells him which way the winds of fate are currently blowing, 
but he knows that enough effort can change the future he sees. If they're unchangeable, then nothing he can do will alter this vision; however, it's still possible that the vision is deceptive and not exactly what he thinks it is. (For instance, when he s
ees his best friend plummeting to his death from a clifftop, he may actually be seeing his friend's twin or doppleganger dying in this manner.)  
\par \tab This is a particularly tricky power to use within the scope of the campaign. Always remember that it's a tool 
for the DM to give a slight advantage to the character and to guide the story, and not a weapon for the priest character to use against the DM or the story. The priest character can't sink into a trance, receive no vision, and then immediately sink into a
nother one and expect to receive a vision then. The endowing of visions is strictly at the DM's pleasure, just as, in the campaign, visions are granted to characters strictly at the god's pleasure.
\par \tab This power is most appropriate to priests of the god of pr
ophecy. However, it's appropriate to priests of any god. In Greek mythology, for example, there were famous prophetic temples devoted to the gods Zeus (a god of the sky, lightning, oaks, and wisdom), Apollo (a god of light, the sun, and music), and Gaea (
the ancient earth-goddess).
\par \tab There is no limit on the number of times per day this power may be used. A character can try to entrance himself several times per day, though this is usually fruitless and annoying. However, the DM can supply a priest-character
 with visions any number of times per day. To keep prophecy from becoming a dominant part of the campaign, it's best to limit the number of visions received, through either of the two methods, to once or twice per }{\i\fs24 month.}{\fs24 
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Low Powers}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab Low Powers are those which are of some usefulness in situations which arise occasionally in the campaign, or are of great usefulness in situations which hardly ever arise. Here are some examples of Low Powers:
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 Analysis, Detection, Identification}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab With this power, t
he priest can identify a category of persons, places, or things. He must be within 10' of the object in order to identify it correctly; he does not have to see it, and the object can be hidden. In some cases, it could even be buried.
\par \tab If the DM designs it as part of the ability, the priest can also }{\i\fs24 analyze}{\fs24  the object and get additional details about it. The type of information brought about by this analysis varies from object to object, as we'll discuss below.

\par \tab Here are some examples:
\par \tab A priest of the god of }{\b\fs24 healing}{\fs24 
 could identify and analyze injury and illness. He could look at an injury and see not just where it hurts, but also if it is infected or poisoned, how long ago it was inflicted, etc. He could look at a sick person and determine which disease affl
icts him, what stage of advancement the disease is in, and what the sick person's chances of recovery are.
\par \tab A priest of the god of }{\b\fs24 good}{\fs24  could }{\i\fs24 detect evil}{\fs24  , as per the first-level Priest spell; analysis would let him know whether the evil were lawful, neutral, or chaotic in orientation.
\par \tab A priest of the god of }{\b\fs24 goldsmithing}{\fs24  could }{\i\fs24 detect gold}{\fs24  , including refined gold that has been hidden or unmined gold still under the earth.
\par \tab Some of these powers of identification and analysis are especially useful, such as those which duplicate }{\i\fs24 detect good, detect evil}{\fs24  , and }{\i\fs24 detect magic}{\fs24 
 spells. These may only be used three times per day. Other powers may be used any number of times per day. These powers are not automatic; the priest must concentrate for a full round in order to use this power.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 Immunities}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab As a Low Power, Immunity can act in one of two ways.
\par \tab A granted Immunity can give the priest an automatically-successful saving throw against one specific type of poison or magic spell. For example, a priest could automatically save against cobra venom, or against the }{\i\fs24 fireball}{\fs24  spell.

\par \tab Alternatively, such an Immunity could give the priest a +2 bonus to Saving Throws against a narrow category of spells; a narrow category of special powers; or a narrow category of poisons
. These are the same categories the Medium Power immunities are broken down into; the difference here is that the Low Power immunity only grants a +2 bonus to saves vs. those attacks, instead of providing an automatically successful saving throw.
\par \tab Therefore, a Low Power immunity could give a priest automatic success against the }{\i\fs24 charm}{\fs24 
 spell; a different one could give the priest automatic success against the paralysis brought on by the ghoul's touch; a different one could provide a +2 bonus to all saving thr
ows vs. all enchantment spells; another one would provide a +2 bonus to all saving throws vs. any sort of paralysis ability or spell.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 Language and Communication}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab As a Low Power, the priest re
ceives one extra language appropriate to the priesthood. If the campaign uses the nonweapon proficiency rules, this power consists of an extra nonweapon proficiency slot which must be used to take one specific extra language.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 Soothing Word}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab With this power, the priest can remove the effects of the }{\i\fs24 fear }{\fs24 spell or can sway the attitude of a hostile crowd or mob.
\par \tab The priest can use this power three times per day. A single use can either: Dispel one application of the}{\i\fs24  fear}{\fs24  spell on one victim; el
iminate one warrior's berserker rage; or momentarily calm down a number of characters or monsters (equal to 2x the priest's experience level in hit dice; therefore an 8th level priest could momentarily calm 16 HD of angry mob, for instance).  
\par \tab This power is primarily useful for getting the attention of an angry group of people and allowing the priest to address them. The combination of the }{\i\fs24 soothing word}{\fs24 
 , the respect that many cultures have for their priests, and the speaking abilities of many priests can often defuse an angry mob.
\par \tab As described above, this power is most appropriate to priests of the gods of healing, love, music, peace, and wisdom.
\par \tab If the DM limits this power still further, it becomes appropriate to other classes of priest. For instance, if the }{\i\fs24 soothing word}{\fs24 
 only works on animals, it becomes appropriate for priests of the gods of animal protection, the earth, fertility, and hunting. If it only works on dwarves, it is appropriate for priests of the god of the dwarven race.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Other Powers}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab Just about any spell can be adapted to a priest's Granted Power.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 Which Spells Can Be Used}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab Priest Granted Powers may not be derived from every spell on the books. Some wizard schools and priest spheres are not permitted for adaptation to granted pow
ers. Normally, when a spell belongs to two schools or spheres, where one is permitted and the other is not, the spell can still be adapted to a granted power; but some exceptions are noted below.
\par \tab Priest Granted Powers may be derived from wizard spells of 
the schools of Abjuration, Alteration, Charm, Greater Divination, Invocation, Lesser Divination, and Necromancy. They may also be derived from priest spells from the spheres of All, Animal, Charm, Creation, Divination, Guardian, Healing, Plant, Protection
, Sun, and Weather.
\par \tab   Priest Granted Powers may }{\i\fs24 not}{\fs24 
 be derived from wizard spells of the schools of Conjuration, Summoning, or Conjuration/Summoning; from Enchantment (spells listed as Enchantment/Charm are permissible, but those listed as belonging to Enc
hantment and any other school are not; for instance, }{\i\fs24 Leomund's Secure Shelter}{\fs24 
 , usable by Alteration and Enchantment, is not allowed); from Illusion or Illusion/Phantasm; from Evocation (if a spell can belong to the school of Evocation, it cannot be taken as a granted power even if it can be used by other schools; for instance, }{
\i\fs24 Melf's Minute Meteors,}{\fs24  usable by evocation and alteration, cannot be taken as a granted power).  
\par \tab   Neither may they be derived from priest spells of the spheres of Astral, Combat (even if a spell belongs to Combat and one other sphere, as }{\i\fs24 shillelagh}{\fs24 
 belongs to Combat and Plant, it cannot be used to make a Granted Power), Elemental, Necromantic, or Summoning.  
\par \tab Note that priest spells are listed with wizard-school designations and with spheres of influence (for example, }{\i\fs24 Animal Friendship }{\fs24 
is shown as an Enchantment/Charm school and of the Animal sphere). When making granted powers from priest spells, ignore the wizardly school and pay attention only to the sphere of influence.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 Maximum Levels}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab Granted Powers may not be derived from wizard spells of fifth level or higher, or from priest spells of fourth level or higher.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 Limitations on Use
\par }{\fs24 \tab  
\par \tab The DM must determine limitations on the use of the Granted Power. (There's no call for a priest to be using his power all the time, every day.)
\par \tab If it's a power which is very useful in a lot of situations (for example, a healing ability), it should be usable on
ce, twice, or three times per day. The more useful it is, the less a priest should be able to use it; thus, a healing power would be usable once per day, while a detection ability might be usable three times per day.
\par \tab The DM can also choose for the power to take considerable time to use; special powers should take a minimum of one round to use; more commonly, they should take a complete turn.
\par \tab  
\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 High, Medium, or Low}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab Once the DM knows which spell the power is derived from and how often and easily it may be used, he can decide whether it is a High, Medium, or Low Power.
\par \tab High Powers are those which frequently can dramatically affect the course of a combat or otherwise affect an adventure. The examples of High Powers listed above (charms, major immunities, 
the ability to inspire fear, shapechange, or turn undead) can all have dramatic and powerful effects on an adventure in progress.
\par \tab Medium Powers are those which frequently give an advantage to the priest, or which occasionally will dramatically affect the 
course of a combat or adventure. The examples of Medium Powers listed above (defiance of obstacles, medium immunities, inciting berserker rages, enhanced language abilities, laying on of hands, and prophecy) all do these things.
\par \tab Low Powers are those which
 only occasionally give an advantage to a priest, but which are also very much in character for the priest and his god. The examples of Low Powers listed above (detection and analysis, minor immunities, minor enhancements to language abilities, soothing w
ord) all meet that definition.
\par \tab So, when a DM creates a new granted power, he must decide which of these three sets of criteria the power meets, and define the power as High, Medium, or Low.
\par \tab In any case, this definition is only a rule-of-thumb guideline to
 how powerful the granted power is. It helps the DM when he's assigning powers to priests of specific mythoi. For instance, if he has created a description of a priesthood and decides that it's just almost powerful enough, and only needs a little bonus (a
 Low Power) to make it just right, he'll be able to choose from his list of available Low Powers and can ignore his listings of High and Medium Powers, which would make that priesthood too powerful.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Followers and Believers}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab At a certain level, priests receive}{\i\fs24  followers }{\fs24 and }{\i\fs24 believers }{\fs24 , men and women of the same faith who serve the priests.
\par \tab To receive their followers and believers, priests must achieve a certain experience level (8th or above, with 9th as the most common level). Soon after (the same ex
perience level or during the next-higher level), the priests must assume the duties of a church leader by building a church or temple (whatever is appropriate to the faith) and ministering over a specific geographic area. At that time, their followers beg
in showing up, and arrive over a period of several weeks.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 What Are They?}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab Followers and Believers are non-player characters who are supposed to help promote the priest's faith. But}{\i\fs24  what}{\fs24  they are in terms of character classes, levels, and duties varies from faith to faith.
\par \tab The DM decides what character classes the followers belong to (based on the needs and orientations of the player-character priests and the beliefs he promotes).  
\par \tab For example, let us say that the priest serves the God of Strength. The followers are likely to be all Warriors and Priests of the same god.  
\par \tab If the priest serves the God of Mischief, the followers are likely to be primarily Rogues and priests of the same god. There may be some Warriors and Wizards among the followers, m
en and women who are particular admirers of this god and his attributes as they pertain to combat and magic.
\par \tab If the priest serves the God of Agriculture, the followers could be Normal Men and Women who don't belong to a specific class, with a few priests of the same god among them.
\par \tab Now, it could be that the priest player-character is trying to create a specialized }{\i\fs24 order}{\fs24  within the more generalized faith. A priest of the God of Everything might want to create a militant order. Though the broad worship of t
he god includes every subject and attribute possible, this priest is devoted to the god's warrior-aspect. Therefore, with the permission of the elders of his faith (and, by inference, the permission of the DM), all this priest's followers would be warrior
s and some priests, probably at higher than first level, whose mission is to bring war to the enemy and then religious enlightenment to the conquered.
\par \tab This sort of thinking is to be encouraged among player-characters. A player who's thinking of creating a 
specific religious order is thinking in character and within the scope of the campaign rather than just thinking about how to acquire more spells and magical items.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Who Are They, and How Do They Know to Arrive?
\par }{\fs24 \tab  
\par \tab The answers to these questions vary from faith to faith. The DM has at least three ways to approach this:
\par \tab (1) The followers are local people who are already worshippers of the priest's god. When they hear that there will be a new priest of that god in their area, they arrive and offer him their services.
\par \tab (2) The followers already belong to another church or temple of the same faith. When the PC announces his intent to build his own temple, his faith's superiors send him followers and believers to help him.  
\par \tab (3) The god subtly inspires people from near and far to journey to the new temple and offer their services to the priest.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 How Many and How Strong Are They?}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab As a general rule of thumb, the priest should receive anywhere from 10 to 100 experienc
e levels worth of followers, with the average being around 30. The DM should decide how many levels of followers show up rather than having the priest-character roll a die.
\par \tab These followers can all be of the same level, or can be of different experience le
vels. Zero-experience characters (i.e., normal men and women) count as 0-level characters. No follower can be of higher level than three levels below the priest (thus, an 8th-level priest cannot have a follower higher than 5th level).  
\par \tab Here are some examples of arrangements of followers that different types of priests can have. With each arrangement, we're presuming 30 levels' worth of followers.  
\par \tab The priest-leader of a militant order could have 24 first-level fighters, one second-level fighter, and two second-level priests.
\par \tab The priest-leader dedicated to the common man could have 56 normal men and women, and two first-level priests.
\par \tab The priest-leader who is part of a bureaucratic hierarchy could have five fifth-level priests and five first-level priests.
\par \tab 
The priest-leader of a temple which is supposed to guide, protect, and teach a community could have one fifth-level priest, one second-level priest, three first-level priests, ten first-level warriors, two second-level warriors, and sixteen normal men
 and women.
\par \tab The DM can assign even more esoteric followers to a priest. The priest of a woods-god might have nymphs and centaurs among his followers, in which case the HD of the monster corresponds to its level (a 2HD monster corresponds to a second-level
 character, while a 2d6+2HD monster corresponds to a third-level character).
\par \tab All these followers constitute priests, warriors, and workers (the normal men and women) belonging to or assigned to the priest's temple or church. Their entire job is serving th
e temple or church; they are housed, fed, and sometimes paid by the temple or church. They aren't the "flock" or whatever you choose to call the populace of the area the priest is supposed to serve.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 How Much Control Does the Priest Have?}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab The priest
's command over these followers varies from faith to faith. A player-character priest cannot assume that he has a tyrant's powers of life and death over this followers and believers. The DM decides what sort of command the priest has over them based on th
e nature of the campaign's culture and on the dictates of the faith.  
\par \tab In a normal faith, the priest will be able to order his followers to work and effort like any employer (and, in a medieval or fantasy setting, employers have more power over their emplo
yees than in contemporary society). He can advise them and (if he chooses) put considerable pressure on them regarding the people they associate with or even marry.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Punishments}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab When he is displeased with their actions or performances, he can punish
 them by restricting their activities and movements, applying corporal punishments (beatings which may not reduce them below three-fourths their starting hit points), and assigning them particularly nasty tasks and duties. If their offenses are sufficient
ly great, he can fire then from service in his church or temple, or even separate them from the faith (as described earlier in this chapter).  
\par \tab Customarily, he cannot incarcerate them for any great length of time (i.e., over a week), seriously injure them 
(perform any punishments which reduce them below three-fourths their starting hit points), kill them (killing them and restoring them to life is still forbidden), or use harmful magic on them, including magic which denies them free choice.
\par \tab Spells which are normally forbidden for purposes of punishment or even "guidance" include }{\i\fs24 
create light wounds, magical stone, shillelagh, charm person or mammal, enthrall, flame blade, heat metal, produce flame, spiritual hammer, call lightning}{\fs24  (except when used to frighten instead of damage),}{\i\fs24 
 cause blindness or deafness, cause disease, curse, summon insects}{\fs24  (except when used to frighten instead of damage), }{\i\fs24 cause serious wounds, poison, produce fire, cause critical wounds, flame strike, insect plague, quest}{\fs24  (except
 when the target willingly undertakes the quest to atone for his misdeeds), }{\i\fs24 spike stones, wall of fire, fire seeds, harm, creeping doom, earthquake, fire storm, wither, energy drain, destruction , or symbol.
\par }{\fs24 \tab Spells like}{\i\fs24  command, entangle, cause fear, hold person ,}{\fs24  and }{\i\fs24 confusion}{\fs24  are permissible, because they last only a short time, or do not change a character's belief about any subject.
\par \tab However, in evil faiths, the priest may be able to order the execution of followers for anything which displeases him. I
n particularly bureaucratic faiths, a priest may not be able to assign any punishment without a process of trial and conviction, or without permission from a higher-ranking priest at the faith's main temple or church. The DM will decide whether or not a p
articular faith has these characteristics . . . but most don't.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Important Followers}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab The DM should create many of these followers as fully-developed NPCs, including names, personalities, ability scores, equipment, etc.
\par \tab When a large group of follower
s are "identical" in class and level (for example, if you have sixteen Normal Men and Women), one or two should be singled out and fully developed. When followers are already more individual (for instance, if you only have two second-level priests or one 
fifth-level fighter), such followers should be fully developed.
\par \tab When possible, it's a good idea to role-play the arrival of such characters within the temple, the better to give the priest PC an idea of what his followers are like.
\par \tab All of this work will make the temple and its inhabitants more immediate and real to the priest character (and the other player-characters).
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 What If They Die or Gain Experience?}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab When followers die, they are replaced by whatever means brought them to the temple in the fir
st place. A new local will volunteer his service, or the church hierarchy will send a replacement, or the god will inspire a new NPC to volunteer his service.
\par \tab   It's all right for followers to gain in experience. A soldier who defends his temple from attackers can be expected to gain experience points; a follower who accompanies his priest on adventures can, too.  
\par \tab Only followers who have been given individual names and personalities should gain in experience. An anonymous first-level fighter guard can be
 expected to remain so; but a named character could rise through levels and become guard-lieutenant, guard-captain, personal bodyguard to the priest, etc.
\par \tab Named followers gain experience at normal rates based on what they do in their adventures. The only 
limits placed on all this personal growth are these: No follower can be higher than three experience levels below the level of the priest; and the levels of all followers of a specific temple or church cannot add up to more than 100. 
\par \tab If a group of follow
ers becomes so experienced that it adds up to more than 100 levels, the DM can take steps to reduce the number of levels. For instance, a senior guard-captain may leave the temple when offered captaincy of a guard-unit in another temple (one closer to his
 family, one more prestigious, etc.). He'd be replaced by a captain of lower level, thus adjusting the available experience levels downward.
\par \tab Whenever a follower dies or leaves, he is replaced by a follower who was at the experience level the original character held when he first became a follower.
\par \tab For instance, let us say that a temple starts with a third-level wizard who acts as the priest's advisor. Through adventuring, this wizard rises to sixth level, and then is killed in an adventure. He will be replaced by a third-level wizard.
\par \tab If a guard-captain rises from second to sixth level in the course of adventuring, and then leaves for service elsewhere, he'll be replaced by a second-level fighter. This doesn't mean that the new fighter is the guard-captain
. The priest may prefer for some other follower, who is higher than second-level, to be the new guard-captain. But the replacement character always arrives at the experience level the original character held }{\i\fs24 when he first became a follower.

\par }{\fs24 \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 What If The Priest-Character Is Scum?
\par }{\fs24 \tab  
\par \tab Inevitably, some campaign priests, including some player-character priests, will see their followers as a resource to be exploited and abandoned for the priest's amusement. For example, a priest might seduce and cruelly aband
on attractive followers, or might send soldierly followers into certain-death situations in order to enhance his own glory.
\par \tab   If the faith is not an evil one, the priest is not following the dictates of his faith and will eventually suffer for it. The fir
st few followers who perish or feel compelled to leave will be replaced normally. After twenty experience levels' worth of followers have left in this manner, however, the other temples of the faith and the local population will "catch on" and the priest 
will find replacements slowing.  
\par \tab At that point, the priest will receive one experience level of replacement follower for every two he loses. (This doesn't even count experience levels gained by followers through adventuring. If a second-level guard-captai
n rises to sixth level and then is wasted in this manner, he'll be replaced by a soldier half his }{\i\fs24 original }{\fs24 experience level, i.e. a first-level fighter.)
\par \tab If the priest loses another twenty levels through neglect or maliciousness, he will receive one exper
ience level of replacement follower for every five he loses. If he loses another ten levels through neglect or maliciousness, he will receive one experience level of replacement follower for every ten he loses. If he loses any more through his misbehavior
, they are not replaced.
\par \tab That isn't the only result of evil behavior. The higher-ranking pr
iests of the faith will launch an investigation, assigning a priest of level equal to the offending priest to his temple to conduct the investigation. If it is this priest's conclusion that the priest has behaved badly, he could find himself punished; he 
could have his temple taken away and could even lose experience levels (if his god is offended by his misbehavior and decides to punish him).
\par \tab Also, the other followers and the flock could become disillusioned. Surviving followers could leave or even betray the priest. The local population could gradually cease to attend the priest's church, and seek their spiritual fulfillment elsewhere.

\par \tab How long does all this take? That's a role-playing consideration. A priest can be corrupt and hide his behavior from the
 faith and from his following for years. If he does "waste" followers, but does so at a very slow rate, it could be years or decades before the population catches on. If he's overt, and flaunts his corruption or wastes his followers at a more advanced rat
e, he could find himself in trouble mere weeks or months after first attracting his followers.
\par \tab However, if the faith is an evil one, such behavior is normal. Wasted followers will be replaced normally. (They are not, however, likely to be }{\i\fs24 loyal}{\fs24  followers, and may conspire to eliminate and replace the priest.)
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Role of the Faith
\par }{\fs24 \tab  
\par \tab The DM must decide what role an individual faith has within the campaign's culture. This role breaks down into four parts:
\par \tab How the faith relates to other faiths;
\par \tab How the faith relates to the aristocracy;
\par \tab How the faith relates to the people; and
\par \tab How the faith relates to foreign faiths.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Relations With Other Faiths}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab Most fantasy cultures tends to fall into one of the following categories:
\par \tab 
\par     Monotheistic By Demand
\par \tab Monotheistic By Dogma
\par \tab Pantheistic, Chief Faith Dominant By Charisma
\par \tab Pantheistic, Chief Faith Dominant By Strength
\par \tab Pantheistic, No Chief Faith
\par \tab   
\par \tab Here's what those terms mean within a campaign.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Monotheistic By Demand:}{\fs24  The faith's god acknowledges that 
there are other gods, but demands that everyone worship him or her alone and not those other gods. If a culture is Monotheistic By Demand, it means that this one faith is the only one legally permitted within the culture. This faith is able to demand a ti
the (discussed earlier in this chapter) of its followers.  
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Monotheistic By Dogma:}{\fs24  Whether it is true or not, the faith claims that there is only one god or goddess and that everyone must worship that one being. If a culture is Monotheistic By Dogma, only 
the one faith is permitted within the culture. Typically, the worshippers are sufficiently inflexible in their belief that they often participate in religious wars in order to extend the domination of their own faith or suppress faiths they consider dange
rous or heretical. This faith is able to demand a tithe of its followers.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Pantheistic, Chief Faith Dominant By Charisma:}{\fs24  This culture concedes that there are several gods with individual faiths or cults associated with them. One, however, is the special fa
vorite of the population, because they consider that god's attribute, personality, or blessings superior to any other god's. Most citizens of the culture worship this chief god and any other gods they choose. In this type of culture, the dominant faith ty
pically asks but is unable to demand a tithe of its followers.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Pantheistic, Chief Faith Dominant By Strength:}{\fs24  This culture concedes that there are several gods with individual faiths or cults associated with them. One, however, is supreme in power, either 
because it has a strong hold on the culture's ruling aristocracy or because the chief god has a power or promises rewards that make his worship necessary. (For example, even in a culture where many gods are worshipped, the god who decides how each person'
s afterlife is to be spent could be the dominant god; or the king of the gods, who rules the god of the afterlife, could instead be dominant.) In this type of culture, the dominant faith is able to demand a tithe of its followers.  
\par \tab  }{\b\fs24 Pantheistic, No Chief Faith:}{\fs24 
 This culture concedes that there are several gods with individual faiths or cults associated with them. Though individual cults may be stronger or weaker than each other, none is dominant throughout the culture. Each faith can o
nly ask, not demand, a tithe of its worshippers. Within the culture, individual }{\i\fs24 communities}{\fs24 
 may have dominant gods; and within those individual communities only, the chief god's worship will correspond to one of the "Pantheistic, Chief Faith Dominant By Ch
arisma" or "Pantheistic, Chief Faith Dominant By Strength" categories. Some cities will not have dominant gods, or may have two or more dominant gods who have joint worship here but not elsewhere. All the gods worshipped within the culture will be perceiv
ed to belong to the same family, or pantheon, of gods.
\par \tab  
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Relations With the Aristocracy
\par }{\fs24 \tab  
\par \tab Once the DM makes the decision about the sort of hold the faith has on the culture, he can decide what sort of relations the faith has on the country's rulers. This was discussed earlier in this chapter, under the heading "Rights of the Priesthood."

\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Relations With the People}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab Then, the DM can determine what sort of re
lationship the faith has with the population. All faiths exert some control over the flock, by helping interpret or define what the flock believes; some faiths exert more power, some less. Some abuse that power, and some don't. Some faiths rule the people
, while others }{\i\fs24 are }{\fs24 the people.
\par \tab The DM needs to ask himself these questions:
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 Is There A Priestly Caste?}{\b\fs24\cf2 
\par }{\fs24 \tab  
\par \tab That is, is Priest the full-time job of the priest, making priesthood something a little distant from ordinary humanity; or do most priests only 
act as priests part-time, having other occupations most of the time, and making priesthood something that any ordinary person can attain?
\par \tab Just because Priest is a character class in the AD&D\'ae game doesn't mean that the campaign culture has a priestly cast
e. In a specific culture, a character could be a blacksmith and also priest of the god of metalwork, or a soldier and also priest of the god of the sun, or a scribe and also priest of the god of death. The character's profession does not have to have any 
bearing on his priestly role . . . though it would be inappropriate to be a soldier and a priest of the god of peace, for instance.
\par \tab In such an arrangement, the character lives in his home, works to make his living, and is an everyday fellow. On occasion, h
e puts on his priestly vestments and attends to his priestly duties (performing marriages, arranging and performing rituals, giving guidance to those who ask it of him, praying to the god for favors). Most of these events take place at the god's temple or
 
church, but most of the faith's priests do not live there; only priests with no other quarters, and followers of the chief priest, would live there. (A priest could live in his own home while his followers lived in the temple!) With this sort of arrangeme
nt, priests are very definitely men and women of the people. They are not supported by tithes (though tithes probably led to the building of the temple), and just about anyone in the culture can become a priest.
\par \tab However, if priests are a distinct caste in the society, then priesthood is (in addition to everything else) a }{\i\fs24 job.}{\fs24 
 It is the priest's principal occupation. Most priests live in the temple or in properties owned by the faith. It may be considerably more difficult to become a priest; someone intendin
g to become a priest may have to go through years of education and enlightenment before becoming a priest. (This isn't all that important from a campaign perspective; player-character priests still start out at first level, but with the understanding that
 they've gone through all this teaching and training before they enter the campaign.)
\par \tab 
\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 Can The Faith Inflict Serious Punishments On Non-Believers?}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab This is a reflection of the faith's political power in the campaign culture. Does the faith have the powe
r to inflict punishment on those who do not follow the faith's principals? Can they imprison, interrogate, or even torture or execute non-believers or worshippers of other faiths?
\par \tab If they can, they're a very powerful faith in the culture, and one which ca
n guide the culture into periods of religious terror (whenever they try to purge the land of heretics, or to conceal elimination of political enemies by pretending they're heretics and purging them) or into all-out wars with cultures of different faiths.

\par \tab 
Giving a faith this right in a campaign means that there's always the danger of religious persecution in the campaign. If it's the campaign's main setting where a faith has this power, the player-characters may find themselves hired to oppose or even to h
elp such an effort of persecution. If it's a foreign power, the heroes may find themselves helping fugitives escape that land, or may even face the oncoming juggernaut of an army when that faith decides it's time for a holy war.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 Is The Faith Indigenous To This Population?}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab Did the faith in question spring from this culture, or was it introduced to this culture by immigration or war?
\par \tab If it sprang from this culture, that's fine.
\par \tab However, if it was introduced into this culture and supplanted an earlier faith, the DM has the opportunity to introduce some interesting story elements because of friction between the two faiths.
\par \tab If the new faith conquered and eliminated the old faith almost completely, then there will be hidden, secret sects of the old faith still in existence . . . sects which plan to re-establish the preeminence of their god.
\par \tab If the new faith has dominated and absorbed the old faith without destroying it, you can deal
 with changes to the culture resulting from that absorption. What if, in the old culture, female priestesses and their goddesses were dominant, while in the new faith male gods and their priests are in power? Or, what if the reverse is true? Or, what if t
h
e old faith oppressed one gender and the new faith treats them as equals? In any case, there will be ongoing struggles, especially struggles of politics and traditions, where believers in the old faith try to keep things traditional and familiar while bel
ievers in the new faith try to impose their own beliefs on the population.
\par \tab As a variant of that, a campaign setting, or even an entire campaign, can be built around a missionary situation, where priests of one faith have been introduced into a setting wher
e a different faith reigns . . .  and have appeared with the intent of converting the local population to their beliefs. This is especially interesting where missionaries of a more sophisticated culture are sent to a more primitive region.
\par \tab The priests of 
the new, intruding faith are sent with the purposes of educating the "natives," challenging and defeating their priests (if any), and converting the native population to the new belief. The priests might have to oppose soldiers of their own land, who are 
raiding and exploiting the natives, or may cooperate with them for the glory and profit of their own temples, depending on whether the DM considers this a "good" or a "bad" faith and cause.
\par \tab In such a setting, player-characters could take on any number of t
asks. They could be the new priests, spreading the new faith. They could be enemies of the new priests (perhaps they're priests of another faith altogether!) working to defeat the missionary efforts of the new priests. They could be warriors or foreign de
f
enders of the native population, fighting the soldiers who steal the native culture's treasures and take natives as slaves. They could be those exploitative soldiers. In as complicated a situation as this one is, there are many opportunities for adventure
 . . .  and for tough ethical questions for the DM to introduce into the campaign.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 What Secondary Roles Does The Faith Fill?}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab The DM also needs to decide if a faith fills one or more cultural niches which are not intrinsically religious.
\par \tab For example
, a faith could be the principal educator of a society. Each temple would then also serve as a school, and all priests would have nonweapon proficiencies which allowed them to teach subjects or preserve knowledge. A faith with this privilege will be a pow
erful one in the culture, because it influences the thinking of each new generation.
\par \tab A faith might have a secondary function as a shelterer of travellers. Each temple would have a wing or annex which was a sort of hotel for travellers, with many of the bro
thers and sisters of the faith "running the hotel." This makes this faith a principal waystation for rumors, and the church would be the first place that people would turn to for news.
\par \tab The faith of the god of Wisdom might be the only one which could suppl
y judges and advocates in trials. The faith of the god of Strength might supply all judges and marshals to athletic events. Perhaps only priests of the god of metalwork can mint coins.
\par \tab It's extra work to introduce these small cultural elements into a campaign setting, but they add a depth of detail to a campaign for the DM who is willing to do that extra work.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Relations With Foreign Faiths}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab Once he's decided how the campaign's chief culture is arranged, the DM can make the same decisions about all the other, foreign, cultures in his world.
\par \tab Then, if he wishes, he can add still more detail to the religious fabric of his campaign setting by defining how different cultures regard one another's religious practices.
\par \tab Some cultures avidly welcome the introduction of new religious elements into their own. Pantheistic cultures, especially those which have no dominant faith, are likely to welcome worship of each foreign god that is encountered.
\par \tab Some cultures violently oppose such an introduction. For example,
 a culture might be pantheistic, worshipping many gods, and yet still believe that its pantheon is the only true pantheon . . .  and that all foreign gods and foreign pantheons are lies or demons.
\par \tab Foreign cultures often worship some of the same gods as th
e campaign's principal culture, but do so under different names, with different rites, and believing in different stories about those gods. A tolerant culture will welcome new interpretations of their gods. An intolerant one will, at best, seek to educate
 the foreign culture to "correct its misunderstandings"; at worst, it will insist that the foreign land be conquered and forcibly "corrected."
\par \tab This, then, is another way to add detail and texture to a campaign: By deciding how foreign faiths regard one ano
ther, and what effect that regard has on the cultures involved. These effects range all the way from increased trade and exchange of knowledge through war, conquest, and even genocide.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Rites and the Calendar}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab Most faiths have regular rites and rituals tied in to the calendar. This is discussed more fully in the "Role-Playing" chapter later in this supplement.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Hierarchy of the Faith}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab 
Most faiths have a definite organization, with more experienced priests leading less experienced ones. In some faiths, bribery and corruption can allow a less experienced priest to gain power and influence over more experienced ones, but this is uncommon.

\par \tab In the AD&D\'ae game, most faiths are organized based on the experience levels of their priests. The higher in level a priest is, the higher he may be in the faith's organization.
\par \tab But the DM needs to note a couple of important facts.
\par \tab First, most NPC priests start at first level and never rise any higher than second. The player-character priest, who gains levels throughout a career that is mostly characterized by }{\i\fs24 adventure}{\fs24  is an exception to the usual rule.

\par \tab Second, the PC priest, with his (comparatively) me
teoric rise through levels, may not wish to or may not be able to enjoy the benefits and responsibilities of most priests. Many priest PCs will wish to forego the duties of running a temple and stay on the road, acting as a mobile agent for their faith. T
his is a viable option for a priest in a campaign.
\par \tab More on this subject is discussed in the "Role-Playing" chapter.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Experience Levels and Hierarchy}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab Below is the usual arrangement of priesthoods in a campaign. First is the organizational structure which NPC priests usually follow; then, we'll talk about player-characters and their place in the structure.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 Level Zero (Normal Men and Women)}{\b\fs24\cf2 
\par }{\fs24 \tab  
\par \tab A "level-zero" priest is someone who has just been accepted into a priestly order and is receiving his ini
tial training. Player-characters do not have to start out at zero-level; the only zero-level priests that the PCs will ever encounter will be NPCs undergoing training.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 Level One-Level Two}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab First-level priests are typically assigned as aids, clerks, 
and assistants to higher-level priests, and keep that assignment through second experience level. During this time, the low-level priests will be getting practical field experience in the execution of their duties, in the way the priesthood works with the
 population, and in the way the priesthood's organization works in the real world.
\par \tab Most first-level priests are assigned to priests of third to fifth level, but some few (especially very capable ones) will be assigned to much more powerful priests.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 Level Three-Level Five}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab At third level, the priest will be assigned to a single community (a village, a small town, a broad tract of land containing many scattered farms, or a single small neighborhood in a large city).
\par \tab If he asks for one, and the faith's
 leaders (i.e., the DM) agree that he needs one, he will be assigned a first-level priest as an assistant. This priest isn't a follower in the same fashion as the followers he receives at a higher level, and might wish to be re-posted elsewhere if his sup
e
rior is unlikable or difficult. (However, if this assignee is still with the priest when that priest reaches eighth or ninth level, the DM might decide for him to become one of the priest's official followers.) If he doesn't ask for a subordinate priest, 
he won't receive one.
\par \tab The priest is assigned a small building to serve him as a temple or church. (This is not the same as a stronghold.) The priest is supposed to finance repairs to the building, food and supplies for himself and any assistants, and salar
ies for any servants he chooses to hire through tithes and donations. Half of all tithes and donations are sent on to the superiors, and the rest go to the priest's own temple for these purposes. If the priest doesn't receive enough tithes and donations, 
the faith will probably not help him; his mission is to inspire his flock, and inadequate tithes and donations are merely evidence that he needs to work harder at it.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 Level Six-Level Seven}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab 
At around sixth level, if the priest has done a good job of maintaining his church and seeing to the needs of his flock, he may be given a more important assignment. He could become the chief priest of a large town (one with more than one church; the thir
d-level priests operating those churches would report to him), or the central church authority over several villages.
\par \tab   He may keep any subordinate he has had previously. He will automatically be assigned two additional first-level priests as subordinates.
 Again, they do not precisely constitute "followers," though those specific characters could become followers when the priest reaches the appropriate level.  
\par \tab If the priest's work does not merit a better posting, he won't lose his experience levels or his
 subordinate, but he'll be stuck in the little church that he has been operating all this time. When a priest reaches sixth or seventh level and is still the priest of a one-horse town, it's often a sign that he is not held in high regard by his superiors
. It may merely be a sign that there are too many priests in the priesthood and advancement is slow.
\par \tab Naturally, a higher-level priest can ask to be posted to or remain posted to such a small community. Some people will snicker at his lack of ambition while others will admire his dedication and his care for the common man.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 Level Eight-Level Nine}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab At around eighth or ninth level, again assuming that the priest has done well in his priestly career so far, he will be allowed to build a stronghold. The fa
ith will finance half its cost, and it remains the property of the faith when the priest retires his post.
\par \tab However, the stronghold is semi-autonomous; the priest's superiors seldom interfere in its operations. They might interfere, especially by sending a
nother priest to investigate, if they receive rumors of incompetence, greed, or trouble from the stronghold. Otherwise, the priest is free to operate it much as he pleases.
\par \tab The priest's assigned area may remain the same. He might continue to be chief prie
st over a large town or collection of villages. At his request and with his superiors' permission, or solely at his superiors' wish, he may instead build his stronghold in some other place: In a frontier where he is supposed to defend the peace, in a wild
erness area where he and his subordinates are supposed to work undisturbed by the secular world, etc.
\par \tab At this same time, the priest will receive his followers, as we have discussed earlier this chapter. The followers manage the stronghold and its duties un
der the priest's administration. As discussed earlier, the levels, classes and goals of these followers will depend on the attributes of the faith and on the specific goals of the priest for his stronghold. If it's to be a military post manned by holy war
riors, the followers will mostly be capable fighters; if it's to be an educational monastery, most of the followers will be Normal Men and Women or first-level priests with appropriate scholastic talents.
\par \tab During this time, the priest's progress and efficiency will be carefully measured by his superiors, who are considering what role the priest will play in the higher-level politics of the faith.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 Level Ten-Level Twelve}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab Sometime between tenth and twelfth levels, the priest may find himself promoted to
 prominence over a much larger area; he will be administering a bigger chunk of the religious "map." Priests of numerous cities and regions in his vicinity (at least a fifty-mile radius) will be reporting to him, and of course he will still be reporting t
o his superiors. By twelfth level, he may be the high priest over an entire nation (assuming that the faith spans several nations, as many faiths do).
\par \tab He does not, however, receive any more followers.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 Level Thirteen-Level Fifteen}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab The most powerful 
of a faith's leaders belong to these experience levels: The high priest of the faith and his immediate advisors. If the DM wishes, politics or the god's preference alone may decide who the high priest is, and the high priest might then not have to be the 
highest-level priest of the faith. The faith's high priest might be chosen by vote or omen, and could be a thirteenth-level priest while all his immediate advisors are of higher level.
\par \tab  
\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 Level Sixteen-Level Twenty}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab These experience levels don't have any effect on the priest's ranking within his faith. They are reflections of additional knowledge that he has learned . . . but don't grant any additional benefits within the structure of the faith.

\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 PC Priests and the Hierarchy}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab 
Now, just how do player-character priests relate to this whole organization? Many campaigns are set "on the road;" the player-characters spend much of their time travelling from place to place in search of adventure, and it's hard to keep a church-bound p
riest active in such a campaign. So, here's how to keep the priest in the campaign.
\par \tab In a campaign, it's often not appropriate for}{\b\fs24  first and second level priests}{\fs24  to be assigned as scribes to some small-time village priest. If the DM wants to avoid this, he 
can assign the character to a third-level priest (especially a physically harmless one, who won't contribute much combat ability to a PC party) who travels. This third-level priest may be a friend and travelling companion of one of the PCs, or may be an u
nusual priest who prefers to train his subordinates by life on the road.
\par \tab   When the PC reaches }{\b\fs24 third level}{\fs24  and is supposed to be assigned his own village, he may instead be given a special mission which will keep him on the road and with the other PCs. For
 instance, if the PC party typically encounters new monsters or magic, the faith may want the PC priest to stay with them to benefit himself (and the faith as a whole) with these new experiences and knowledges. The PC priest could keep this assignment all
 the way from }{\b\fs24 third to seventh levels.}{\fs24   
\par \tab At }{\b\fs24 eighth or ninth level,}{\fs24  when the PC is supposed to be "settling down" and building a stronghold, he should do so. The DM should work up a whole series of adventures centered around the stronghold, its construction
 and defense. After the stronghold is built and settled with followers, if the PC priest wants to remain on the road with his allies, he should be able to do so. He must leave most of his followers at the church to operate it, and should take no more than
 
two followers with him. Naturally, the stronghold was built and organized with this in mind, and the priest will still have to return to the stronghold a few times per year in order to sign important papers and set new policies . . .  but for the rest of 
the year he's doing the temple's business on the road.
\par \tab This can remain the situation for the rest of the priest's career in the campaign. Alternately, as the priest reaches higher levels, the DM may wish to orient the campaign around him and the concerns o
f his faith; we discuss this in the "Role-Playing" chapter.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Finances of the PC's Temple}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab We mentioned tithes and donations above, and there's always a temptation to provide some sort of lengthy and involved money-management scheme for the campaign, so that the DM can keep track of every copper piece that flows through the temple coffers.

\par \tab But that doesn't contribute to the spirit of adventure that AD&D\'ae game campaigns are supposed to promote. So we're going to provide you with a much simpler system for keeping up with a temple's tithes and donations.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 The First Temple Assignment}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab When the priest character is first assigned a temple or church, the DM decides, entirely arbitrarily, whether the faithful who attend that temple contribute enough for the priest to lead a mean, average, or comfortable existence.
\par \tab "Mean" indicates that he gets barely enough to eat and cannot afford repairs or salaries for servants; "Average" means that he and one subordinate get an ample diet and can afford one servant; 
"Comfortable" means that the temple can house more than just its one or two priests (it can, for example, house one or two horses per priest) and can afford two or more servants per priest.
\par \tab Then, the DM decides whether or not this economic condition is on
e that will change with the priest's management. If the local population isn't contributing as much as it could, the new priest might be able to inspire them to a better performance. If the last priest was a very charismatic leader, then perhaps the new p
riest will start out with a Comfortable or Average existence but then see it start to slip away.
\par \tab Then, from time to time, the DM can confront the priest with situations which can affect his standing.  
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Example:}{\fs24  An unpopular man seeks sanctuary in the prie
st's church; if the priest denies sanctuary, he'll be more popular with the locals, but will not have done his priestly duty; if he provides sanctuary, he'll have done his duty, but will see contributions slip or dry up altogether. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Example:}{\fs24  A young man o
f the area asks the priest's advice on a difficult problem: Should he marry the girl of his choice, and alienate his father, or acquiesce to his father's arranged marriage, and wed the wealthy girl he does not love? If the priest answers one or the other,
 
it has no effect on his standing in the community. But if he can suggest and implement a plan which will allow the youth to marry his love, keep his father's affection, and not alienate the family of the spurned girl, the priest's standing will be improve
d, and so will the economics of his temple.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 Later Assignments}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab   As the priest is given larger and more important postings and assignments, the DM should assign him to temples which are always compromises for him. The DM decides how many men and wome
n these temples have on their staffs, what the standard of living is for the temple-dwellers (usually modest, though not uncomfortable, etc.). And these temples simply do not receive enough from tithes and donations normally to live up to all his expectat
ions, much less to build up a large treasury of available coins.  
\par \tab  }{\b\fs24 Example:}{\fs24  If the priest dreams of having a body of soldiers decked out in full plate and riding trained warhorses, what he has is a squadron of foot soldiers in chain.
\par \tab  }{\b\fs24 Example:}{\fs24  If the priest wants to live a luxurious existence, with expensive furnishings and many servants and a hedonistic lifestyle, what he gets is dull stone walls, used furnishings, and one scruffy servant (or none).
\par \tab In all situations like this, the priest must either:
\par \tab 
(1) Re-structure the temple's budget, which results in shortages elsewhere in the temple's existence (taking from the kitchen to pay the armory results in poorer food and worse cooking; taking from the armory to redecorate makes for brighter and less-defe
nsible temples; taking from the repair fund to improve the kitchen makes for better meals and buildings which start to fall apart; etc.);  
\par \tab (2) Finance the changes from his adventuring treasures (which means that the priest will find it hard to save up a "retirement fund" of any consequence); or
\par \tab (3) Tap into the monies which are supposed to be sent on to the higher ranks of the faith (which will work for a time, perhaps a very long time, but will eventually result in a temple investigation . . .  which is 
very bad for the faith as a whole, as it causes disillusionment among the populace when the true facts emerge).
\par \tab   
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 Notes on Economics}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab By presenting temple economics as choices of lifestyle ethics, rather than numbers on a column-sheet, the DM encourages role-playing within his campaign and doesn't have to devote a lot of time to keeping track of silver pieces.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Non-Priests Working For the Faith}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab One last note about levels of priests within the faith: There are many non-priest characters who belong to the administrative organization of any faith in a campaign world.
\par \tab Most are Normal Men and Women who work in individual temples, as servants, messengers, grooms, and sometimes as teachers, scribes, and consultants.
\par \tab Many are warriors hired to protect temples in dangerous areas, to act as bodyguards for travelling priests, and to train priests in the finer points of combat.
\par \tab Some are mages, bards, and even thieves hired as consultants and specialists.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 PCs, Forces and Philosophies}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab Some players will eventually ask themselves, "If the gods are sentient but forces and philosophies are not, then if I become priest of a force or philosophy, I don't have some god dictating what I can and can't do. I can do anything I want to."  

\par \tab The DM needs to step on this sort of foolishness when it crops up. Though forces and philosophies are not sentient beings, they can still enforce their ethos and tenets on their priests.
\par \tab For example, if a priest of the Philosophy of Good does evil things, the natural power of the philosophy will abandon him (denying him all his priestly until he repents, makes amends, and again follows the restrictions of the priesthood).
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Sample Priesthoods}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab The next chapter contains more than sixty individual priest classes. Each has been built according to the guidelines discussed in this chapter, and can be introduced as written or with modifications into most DMs' campaigns.  
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Faith Design Sheet}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab On page }{\i\fs24 39}{\fs24  is the Faith Design Sheet, a worksheet which will help the DM design his own faiths. You can use any of the Sample Priesthoods from the next chapter as a template, or create a faith from the ground up.
\par \tab The Faith Design Sheet is arranged to follow, more or less in order, the subjects of this chapter.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs32\cf2 Sample Priesthoods}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab Here, we're providing examples of what we described in such detail in the previous chapter. 
\par \tab In the pages that follow, you'll find more than sixty priesthoods. Each of these priesthoods constitutes a complete character class of the "priest of a specific mythos" type. The }{\i\fs24 druid}{\fs24  presented in the }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook}{
\fs24  is one type of a priest of a specific mythos, and is written up there in greater detail than the priesthoods presented here. But each of these priesthoods can be fine-tuned by your DM and adapted more fully to the campaign world.
\par \tab Each of these priesthoods follows the normal Priest rules (}{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook}{\fs24 , page 33) for experience level progression and spell progression. Most foll
ow the normal Priestly eight-sided dice progression for hit points; those which don't will be singled out in the text.
\par \tab For each of these priesthoods, your DM will ultimately have to supply the campaign-specific details of what the deity's name is, what hi
s family and relationships are, what his history is, etc. However, players don't have to know all these details in order to create priest characters; just use the priesthood class descriptions below, and, when options are provided (for skills, requirement
s, powers, etc.), the players can ask the DM which options they should take.  
\par \tab This section supplements the material from the "Weapons Allowed" chart from the }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook,}{\fs24  page 34.
\par \tab   
\par \tab  
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Priesthoods}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab Below are the priest character classes. The description of each is arranged in this fashion:
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Sample Faith Writeup}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab We start out with a quick explanation of the god's attribute. The first paragraphs talk about what the god's goals may be, what his priest's goals will be.
\par \tab Next, we discuss what kinds of variations there may be to his attribute. (Example: A god of the arts may be devoted to only one specific kind of art -- painting, for instance).
\par \tab Sometimes these variations on the god's attribute might
 change your opinion of what the god's nature and alignment are. (Example: A god of death might be a frightening Grim Reaper sort of deity, or might be a gentle god of a cheerful sort of afterlife.)
\par \tab We also describe the gender that gods of this attribute usually belong to.}{\i\fs24  This isn't a limitation for your campaign.}{\fs24 
 Any attribute shown below can be represented by a god or goddess, or even by a sexless deity. However, in real-world mythologies, various godly attributes are usually represented by one sex or the other, and so here we describe which one that is.
\par \tab We also talk about the other types of priests this priesthood is on especially good terms with. (Just because a priesthood isn't mentioned here doesn't mean that there is bad feeling between them, however.)
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Alignment:}{\fs24  This paragraph describes the usual alignment of such a god, and the alignment choices available to his priests.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Minimum Ability Scores:}{\fs24  This text explains what minimum ability scores (always Wisdom, and often one other) the priest must possess to be a priest in the first place.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Races Allowed:}{\fs24  This paragraph describes which player-character races may belong to this priesthood. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Nonweapon and Weapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24  This paragraph describes which nonweapon and weapon proficiencies a priest m
ust have, and which additional nonweapon proficiencies are recommended for him. The proficiencies required of the priest must be taken from the normal proficiency slots he starts play with; he does not receive }{\i\fs24 extra }{\fs24 
slots with which to take these proficiencies. Also listed here are the "Nonweapon Proficiency Group Crossovers" for this specific priest-class (see Table 38, }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook,}{\fs24  page 55 for more on the Proficiency Group Crossovers).

\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Duties of the Priest:}{\fs24 
 This talks about the duties typically demanded of this sort of priest. Almost all priests are supposed to provide Guidance to the flock; generally, that guidance is related to the god's attribute. (In other words, members of the flock come to the priest 
o
f the god of love for questions of love, to the priest of the god of justice on questions of revenge, etc.) All priests except for the priests of the god of Death can perform the marriage ceremony, and this is a duty most don't mind performing. Many pries
thoods have other duties as well.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Weapon and Armor Restrictions:}{\fs24  Here, we talk about which weapons and armor the priest can and cannot use. Mentioned in these paragraphs are some weapons which do not appear in the }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook.}{\fs24 
 The belaying pin, bo stick, cestus, chain, daikyu, lasso, main-gauche, net, nunchaku, sai, shuriken, stiletto, and swords such as cutlass, katana, rapier, sabre, and wakizashi appear in }{\i\fs24 The Complete Fighter's Handbook.}{\fs24 
 The bill, lasso, maul, net, nunchaku, and scythe appear later in this supplement, in the "Equipment" chapter (note that the bill is the same as the gaff/hook from }{\i\fs24 The Complete Fighter's Handbook}{\fs24 
; "gaff" and "hook" are its nautical names). Of the armors mentioned, banded mail, brigandine, bronze plate mail, chain ma
il, field plate, full plate, plate mail, ring mail, scale mail, splint mail, and studded leather constitute metal armor (not all of them are all-metal, but all of them have metal elements); hide armor, leather armor, and padded armor constitute non-metal 
armor.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Other Limitations:}{\fs24  Here, we discuss other limitations and restrictions which are typically placed on this type of priest.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Spheres of Influence:}{\fs24  This paragraph describes the priest's access to spells of different spheres of influence. You'll remembe
r from the previous chapter that priesthoods which have Good Combat Abilities tend to get three major accesses (including All) and two minor, that those which have Medium Combat Abilities tend to get five major accesses (including All) and four minor, and
 that those which have Poor Combat Abilities tend to get seven major accesses (including All) and six minor. In the examples below, not all priesthoods follow those guidelines}{\i\fs24  exactly}{\fs24 
; some have one major access to few and a couple of minor accesses to many, for instance. But if a priesthood comes up notably short on the number of spheres it can access, it is given extra Granted Powers.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Powers:}{\fs24  This paragraph talks about which Granted Powers the priest receives, and when this occurs during the course of his
 career. Most priesthoods have at least one; some have several. Unless the text says otherwise, each Granted Power is available to the priest at first experience level; some, specifically listed, will become available at other levels.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Followers and Strongholds:}{\fs24 
 Here, we talk about how many followers the priest receives, what they are, when he receives them, and when he is allowed to build his own stronghold. We also describe how many and which of his followers can take with him when adventuring "on the roa
d." Normally, most of the followers are supposed to stay at the priest's temple and operate it for him; in spite of many priest-PCs' preferences, the priest can't just bring along all his followers with him on every adventure. The numbers given here are f
or the maximum number of followers the priest can take with him on adventures; naturally, he can always take fewer.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Possible Symbols:}{\fs24  This is a set of recommendations for the symbols that the priesthood uses. Usually, they're representations of the god's attribute. They are also used upon the priesthood's Holy Symbol.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Notes:}{\fs24  Finally, if there are any further items important to the description of this character class, we place them in this paragraph.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Important Notes}{\fs24  
\par \tab  
\par \tab Most godly attributes (Love, War
, Agriculture, etc.) don't specifically say that they are enemies of Evil. This just means that these attributes are not of themselves distinctly opposed to Evil; some have no relationship with Evil whatsoever (for example, Agriculture). You can assume, u
nless the text lists Evil among the friends of an attribute, or says that priests of this other god can be evil, that the priests of the other god don't care for the Philosophy of Evil.
\par \tab We haven't included a paragraph which discusses the rights the priesth
ood has in the culture. That's because we don't know what sort of culture the DM will be placing the priesthood within. The DM determines what special rights the priesthood has; special rights, as discussed last chapter, include Church Trial, Coronation, 
Other Confirmations, Tithes, Separation from the Faith, Rule, and being the State Religion.
\par \tab Also, the guidelines we're providing in this chapter are based on the most common views of these sorts of gods, priests, and races. Any campaign may have a differen
t view of these topics, and so the DM may change these limitations and requirements to suit his campaign. Especially prone to re-interpretation are: races allowed, proficiencies required or forbidden, rights, weapon and armor restrictions, other limitatio
ns, and spheres of influence.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 Agriculture}{\fs24  
\par \tab  
\par \tab Agriculture concerns Man harvesting Nature. The god has shown man how to plant, grow, reap, and utilize crops; man, in turn, worships the god as thanks for this bounty. The gods of agriculture is different 
from the other gods of nature and natural forces in that he represents the elements of growing that man utilizes and can control.
\par \tab The priesthood of this god is principally interested in making sure that mankind continues to appreciate the agricultural god
. An angry god of this sort can decide that crops fail, either on a local level or even worldwide, resulting in mass starvation and (eventually, if the god is not appeased) a destruction of civilization; man would return to a hunter-gatherer culture, livi
ng in small nomadic tribes and following herds of beasts, if this were to take place.
\par \tab A god of Agriculture doesn't have to be the god of all agriculture. He could be the god of a specific crop (especially wheat, barley, corn, vines, olives, and other princ
ipal crops) or of a specific, lesser attribute of agriculture (sowing, reaping, brewing, etc.).
\par \tab Most agricultural deities are female.
\par \tab The priests of this god are on good terms with Druids and the priests of Community, Earth, Fertility, Fire, Life-Death-Rebirth Cycle, Nature, Seasons, and Vegetation.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Alignment:}{\fs24  The deity is true neutral. His priests may be true neutral or neutral good; most are neutral good. The flock may be of any alignment.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Minimum Ability Scores:}{\fs24  Wisdom 11, Constitution 12. Wisdom or Constitution 16 means +5% experience; Wisdom }{\i\fs24 and}{\fs24  Constitution 16 means +10% experience.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Races Allowed:}{\fs24  Gnomes, half-elves, halflings, humans.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Nonweapon and Weapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24  Nonweapon Proficiencies Required: Agriculture. Nonweapon Proficiencies Recom
mended: Local History, Reading/Writing, Religion. Weapon Proficiencies Required: None. Nonweapon Proficiency Group Crossovers: Priest, General.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Duties of the Priest:}{\fs24  Guidance, Marriage. Observation of annual celebrations at the start of winter and start o
f spring. Vigilance against any threat to the community's ability to grow its food, including magical blights and droughts brought on by evil magicians or priests, artifacts or enemy gods.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24\cf1 Weapon and Armor Restrictions:}{\fs24  Weapons Permitted: Bill, flails (bo
th), hand-throwing axe, scythe, sickle. Armor Permitted: All non-magical non-metal armor, all non-magical (non-metal) shields. Oriental Campaigns: Also nunchaku. All together, these constitute Poor combat abilities.
\par \tab  }{\b\fs24 Other Limitations:}{\fs24  None.
\par \tab  }{\b\fs24 Spheres of Influence:}{\fs24  Major Access to All, Creation, Divination, Plant, and Summoning (can only use }{\i\fs24 wall of thorns , weather summoning ,}{\fs24  and }{\i\fs24 creeping doom}{\fs24 
 from this sphere). Minor Access to Animal, Healing, Protection, Sun, and Weather. This does not give the priest all the spheres indicated for a priest with Poor Combat Abilities, so he'll also have more than one Granted Power.
\par \tab  }{\b\fs24 Powers:}{\fs24  }{\i\fs24 Analysis, Detection, Identification}{\fs24  (as described in the Designing Faiths chapter) of any sort of domesticated grain or 
garden plant; the priest can look at a field and tell what's being grown, how far along it is in the harvest year, what the state of the crop is (healthy, diseased, drought problems, etc.), and even what species is growing it (this can be handy when the p
arty is sneaking up on the dwelling of an unknown monster and there is a garden nearby, for instance). }{\i\fs24 Create Food & Water}{\fs24 : The Priest can cast this spell once per day in addition to all other spells that he can cast. }{\i\fs24 Immunity:
}{\fs24  The Priest is immune to the harmful effects of spoiled vegetable or fruit substances; he will never be laid low by normal food poisoning. (He's not immune to deliberate poisoning of food, or of food poisoning in meats.) }{\i\fs24 At 8th Level:}{
\fs24  The Priest can cast the }{\i\fs24 heroes' feast}{\fs24  spell once per day in addition to all other spells that he can cast.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Followers and Strongholds:}{\fs24  The followers are received at 8th level, and consist of one fifth-level priest, one third-level priest, one second-level priest, and ten first-level priests, all of the sam
e god, plus one second-level warrior and eight first-level warriors to act as guards. The priest may take the following on adventures: Three priests and two warriors of his choice. The priesthood will pay for half of the cost of stronghold construction at
 8th level. The stronghold must act as a central source of information about agricultural techniques for the farmers of the area; the priests must not turn away farmers who come for advice.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Possible Symbols:}{\fs24  Sickle, scythe, sheaf of wheat.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Notes:}{\fs24  The weapons chosen for this priesthood are those which have some bearing in agriculture.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 Ancestors}{\fs24  
\par \tab  
\par \tab This is a god devoted to man's communion with and honoring of his dead ancestors. As such, this is a god of civilization and learning, even of courtesy.
\par \tab The priests of this god keep the deeds of ancestors and heroes in the minds of the population. They commune with and honor the dead, and are also devoted to learning from them # not just reading their writings, but communicating with them magically,
 even exploring alternate planes to understand the meaning of life and death.
\par \tab They are also devoted to the protection of new generations, whom they teach to appreciate the previous generations of this race.
\par \tab This priesthood places a high value on truth. 
\par \tab Priests of the god of ancestors }{\i\fs24 hate }{\fs24 the undead, regarding them as a mockery of true and noble death. These priests seek to eradicate the undead whenever encountered.
\par \tab Lesser gods of this attribute would be devoted to subsets of the broad field of Ancesto
rs. Such subsets include: Ancestors of a particular race, of a particular city, of a particular extended clan; all male ancestors, all female ancestors, all warrior ancestors, all scholar ancestors, etc. It would be appropriate for a civic deity (see }{
\b\fs24 Community}{\fs24 , below) also to be a god of the city's ancestors, for instance.
\par \tab Ancestor deities are not inclined toward either sex.
\par \tab The priests of this god are on good terms with the priests of Birth/Children, Community, Divinity of Mankind, Fate/Destiny, Race, and Sites. The priests of this god dislike the priests of Disease.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Alignment:}{\fs24  The deity is neutral good. His priests may be chaotic good, neutral good, or lawful good. The flock may be of any neutral or good alignment.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Minimum Ability Scores:}{\fs24  Wisdom 12. Wisdom 16 means +10% experience.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Races Allowed:}{\fs24  Dwarves, elves, gnomes, half-elves, halflings, humans.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Nonweapon and Weapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24  Nonweapon Proficiencies Required: Local History. Nonweapon Proficiencies Recommended: Reading/Writing, Heraldry, Reli
gion. Weapon Proficiencies Required: None. Nonweapon Proficiency Group Crossovers: Priest, General.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Duties of the Priest:}{\fs24  Guidance, Marriage. Education: These priests must teach new generations the value of veneration of ancestors, and are therefore also 
repositories of a lot of historical knowledge. Missions: To investigate old mysteries, find out what really }{\i\fs24 did}{\fs24 
 happen to famous ancestors who disappeared or perished mysteriously, sort out the truth from old legends of the city's heroes, etc. Prophecy: Listening to the omens whispered by the dead.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Weapon and Armor Restrictions:}{\fs24  Weapons Permitted: Club, dagger/dirk, dart, knife, quarterstaff. Armor Permitted: None; no shields. Oriental Campaigns: Also bo stick. All together, these constitute Poor combat abilities.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Other Limitations:}{\fs24  None.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Spheres of Influence:}{\fs24  Major Access to All, Astral, Creation, Divination, Guardian, Necromantic, Protection. Minor Access to Charm, Healing. This does not give the priest all the minor accesses to spheres indicated for a 
priest with Poor combat abilities, so he'll also have some Granted Powers.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Powers:}{\fs24   }{\i\fs24 Detection}{\fs24  (as described in the Designing Faiths chapter) of graves and undead. The priest can detect graves where remains lie, and the presence of undead, within 60'; he c
an tell the difference between the truly dead and the undead, but has no other analytical ability (i.e., he cannot tell that the undead detected is a vampire); through wooden or thin stone walls, he can only detect them at a distance of 30', and through t
hick stone or the earth can only detect them at 10' distance. (Therefore, when he walks over a grave, he will only detect its presence if it is 10' or less down.) }{\i\fs24 Immunity }{\fs24 
(as described in the Designing Faiths chapter) to the charm abilities of undead creatures such as the vampire. Turn undead (same as the Cleric ability). }{\i\fs24 At 8th level: Prophecy}{\fs24 
 (as described in the Designing Faiths chapter); the priest cannot actively try to prophesy; when receiving prophecies, he is hearing the voices of the dead advising him.
\par \tab  }{\b\fs24 Followers and Strongholds:}{\fs24 
 The followers are received at 8th level, and consist of five third-level priests and fifteen first-level priests, all of the same priesthood. The priest may take the following on adventures: Five priests, no more than two 
of whom may be chosen from the third-level priests. The priesthood will pay for half of the cost of stronghold construction at 8th level. The stronghold must also act as a genealogical library for the surrounding communities, and will constantly be visite
d by scholars looking for information on families and ancestry (or who come with information to contribute).

This god is the protector of animals. He could intend to protect animals from all harm, and thus be the enemy of all hunters, rangers, and carnivores of all descriptions. Most often he's primarily interested in keeping animal species intact, not allowing 
them to be hunted to extinction, etc., and thus allows a reasonable amount of hunting and trapping to take place.
\par \tab The priests of this god also work hard to keep excess hunting and trapping in check, and to remind the flock that the god will avenge abuses. 
Typically, this god is content to be counted as one of many gods and almost never insists on being the primary deity worshipped by the flock.
\par \tab A lesser type of animal-god is one who is the protector of a single species or group of species. Such a deity mig
ht be the lion-god, or the god of all felines, or the god of elephants, or the god of porpoises and dolphins. In a primitive society, all members of a nomadic tribe might worship the god of the herd animal the tribe hunts (bison, for example).
\par \tab Animal deities are often male.
\par \tab The priests of this god are on good terms with Druids and the priests of Earth, Fertility, Hunting, Life-Death-Rebirth Cycle, Nature, Oceans/Rivers (only if priesthood has some association with aquatic animals), and Race (Elven).
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Alignment:}{\fs24  The deity is true neutral. The priests may be neutral evil, true neutral, or neutral good; evil priests have their own sect and the other priests don't have to tolerate them. The flock may be of any alignment.

\par \tab  
\par \tab This god celebrates the arts, particularly the visual arts (such as painting and sculpture).
\par \tab The priests of this god are devoted to encouraging the visual arts of every sentient race; and though they seem to be devoted to a non-violent cause, they have to learn so many different types of magic (especially D
ivination, to learn, and Creation, to create), they are very powerful magically, even in combat situations.
\par \tab Lesser gods of this attribute would be devoted to specific arts: A God of Sculpture, for example.
\par \tab Gods of the arts are equally likely to be of either sex.

\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Duties of the Priest:}{\fs24 
 Guidance, Marriage. Encouragement of people, even those not in the flock, who exhibit artistic abilities. Participation in semiannual events where artists' works are displayed (in shows, or before the local rulers, or in displays in the mark
etplace). Punishment of those who defile or destroy great works of art. Vigilance: Art often shocks the sensibilities of those who do not appreciate certain of its forms, so these priests must be vigilant against censorship.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Weapon and Armor Restrictions:}{\fs24  Weapons Permitted: Bows (all). Armor Permitted: None; no shields. Oriental Campaigns: Also daikyu. All together, these constitute Poor combat abilities.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Other Limitations:}{\fs24  Priests of the Arts gain only 6-sided hit dice, not 8-sided.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Spheres of Influence:}{\fs24 
 Major Access to All, Astral, Creation, Divination, Elemental, Plant, Protection, Sun. Minor Access to Healing, Necromantic. This gives the priest one extra major access and four too few minor accesses, for a priest with Poor Combat Ab

mmune (receives an automatically-successful saving throw) to all first-level wizard Illusion spells for which a saving throw is possible, and gets a +2 saving throw vs. all other Illusion spells for which a saving throw is possible (he can't make a saving
 throw against someone else's }{\i\fs24 invisibility}{\fs24 
, for instance). Additionally, even when he fails a saving throw or a saving throw doesn't apply, he can still tell when the following spells are being used (if he can see the area affected by the spell): }{\i\fs24  change se
lf , spook , Leomund's trap , fear , hallucinatory terrain , and vacancy.}{\fs24 
 This ability does not allow the priest to tell which spell is being used. Also, this does not make the priest immune to the effects of the spell (for example, he'll still be scared by }{\i\fs24 spook }{\fs24 ), but he'll know it was an illusion.

riest must act as a patron of the arts for the surrounding area, and must work to make his stronghold a center for the teaching of those who show artistic promise.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Possible Symbols:}{\fs24  Chisel, pallet, paint brush.

\par \tab This god's interest is in the safe and successful birthing of children and, subsequently, their protection and nurturing.

\par \tab Gods of birth, children, and youth tend to be female.

\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Powers:}{\fs24   }{\i\fs24 Turn undead}{\fs24  (same as the Cleric ability); the priests of this faith, which is symbolic of life, are therefore enemies of and have some power over the undead.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Followers and Strongholds:}{\fs24  The followers are received at 8th level, and consist of one fifth-level priest, t
hree third-level priests, and six first-level priests, all of the same order, plus one third-level paladin and seven first-level fighters to act as guards and soldiers. The priest may take the following on adventures: Two priests and two fighters of his c
hoice, and the paladin. The priesthood will pay for half of the cost of stronghold construction at 8th level. The stronghold must act as a maternity hospital for the local community, and may turn away no woman who is close to having her child.

\par \tab  
\par \tab When a god's principal interest is in one city (its growth, defense, and prosperity), he's called a god of community or, more commonly, a }{\i\fs24 civic}{\fs24  }{\i\fs24 deity}{\fs24 .
\par \tab The priests of the civic deity are responsible for making sure that the god receives worship from the city's inhabitants, and promote all sorts of plans and efforts to improve the city: Civic improvement plans, improvement of the
 city walls and army, etc.
\par \tab One god may be the civic deity of several cities, or each city could have its own, lesser god.
\par \tab The DM may not wish for there to be so many gods in his campaign world. If this is the case, then a civic deity should also (and pri
marily) be the god of some other attribute, and would be a given city's civic deity in addition. For example, in Greek mythology, Athena was primarily the goddess of wisdom, and had secondary attributes as a goddess of war, of crafts, and of the city of A
thens.
\par \tab Civic deities are just as commonly male as female.
\par \tab The priests of this god are on good terms with the priests of Agriculture, Ancestors, Arts, Birth/Children, Death, Guardianship, Marriage, Messengers, Peace, Prosperity, Race, Rulership/Kingship, Sites, Trade, and War.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Alignment:}{\fs24 
 A deity whose sole attribute is that he is the protector/patron of a single community has an alignment appropriate to that community. Most are true neutral; their interest is in the survival of the community by any means, 
whether by law, chaos, good, or evil. Their priests may be of any alignment, but evil priests gather in one cult, neutral priests in another, and good priests in a third; at the DM's discretion, they don't have to get along. The flock may be of any alignm
ent. The DM can decide that a particular civic deity is neutral good, in which case there will be no evil priests or flock; or that he is neutral evil, in which case there will be no good priests or flock.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Minimum Ability Scores:}{\fs24  Wisdom 10, Charisma 12. Wisdom or Charisma 16 means +5% experience; Wisdom }{\i\fs24 and}{\fs24  Charisma 16 means +10% experience.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Races Allowed:}{\fs24  Dwarves, elves, gnomes, half-elves, halflings, humans. If a community has only one type of sentient race inhabiting it (or is principally devoted to one
 race), then the priests may be only of that race; if the population consists of several types of sentient races, then the priests of the community god may be of any race.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Nonweapon and Weapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24  Nonweapon Proficiencies Required: Local History

\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Duties of the Priest:}{\fs24  Guidance, Marriage. Education: The 
priest must preserve the history of the city, teach it to the young of his flock, and never let it be forgotten. Vigilance: Against any threat to his city. This is why priests of community deities often wander the wider world: They are acting as an intell
igence network for the city, keeping their ears open for any hint of threat or danger to the city from outside.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Weapon and Armor Restrictions: }{\fs24 Weapons Permitted: Dagger/dirk, knife, and any two from the following list (the DM decides based on which weapons
 are most representative of the city in question; at least one weapon should be in the 1d8 or greater damage range): Battle axe, bows (all), crossbow, flails (both), harpoon, lance, mace, morning star, net, polearm, quarterstaff, spear, sword/bastard, swo
r

\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Spheres of Influence:}{\fs24  Major Access to All, Creation, Healing.
\par \tab Minor Access to Combat, Protection. These choices
 don't give the priest access to very many spells, so this priesthood will have good Granted Powers. Note that the DM may wish to substitute some other choice for the Major Access to Creation and the Minor Access to Combat if the civic deity that he has c
reated has secondary attributes not reflected in this listing.

\par \tab This is the god of competition, especially of athletic competition. This god stresses fairness, impartiality, and truth in his followers. He is also a proponent of health, exercise, and physical self-improvement.
\par \tab His priests follow the same goals, and support these goals by conducting regular athletic exercises and games, and by acting as impartial judges for those games.
\par \tab Gods of lesser parts of the Competition attribute might be gods of specific events; for example, to be the god of Boxing or Wrestling m
ight be a very honorable thing. It would be far less dramatic to be the god of the Broad Jump or the god of Synchronized Swimming, however.
\par \tab Gods of competition are usually male.
\par \tab The priests of this god are on good terms with the priests of the Divinity of Mankind, Fortune/Luck, Justice/Revenge, Peace, and Strength.

priests of this god as judges, but the later rounds of events, and especially the finals, will be judged only b
y these priests.) Vigilance: Against unfairness. Priests of this god loathe unfairness and dishonesty above all other human traits. This isn't just unfairness in the sports arena: They also oppose unjust rule. Additionally, when two forces of basically eq
ual honor and righteousness clash, these priests, if they choose to become involved, tend to support the weaker side, the underdog.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Weapon and Armor Restrictions}{\fs24 : Weapons Permitted: Bows (all), crossbow, dagger/dirk, hand/throwing axe, javelin, knife, lance, spear, sword (DM chooses}{\i\fs24  one}{\fs24

 he may not use them in competition matches, and he may not use them in challenge matches with enemies unless he declares their presence to the enemy in question. If he violates this rule, he offends his god; this is an "in

st culture of all, then his priests are charged with turning every other culture into this best culture. Consequently, the priesthood invades other nations, peacefully if possible, setting up missions and trying to convert the population wholesale to the 
worship of this god, and to the cultural behavior of the god's favorite civilization.  
\par \tab When peaceful intrusion is not possible, the priesthood agitates for war with the other civilization; if the civilization can be conquered, they move in to convert is p

\par \tab This god cautions the mortal races to accept whatever fate that the gods or even a higher Destiny have in store for them. This is the god of acceptance, of resignation, of coping without struggling.
\par \tab Priests of this faith believe that everything that happens is predestined. They preach a doctrine of acceptance of the will o
f the gods, including gods other than their own. When two gods are in opposition, these priests do not interfere in the mortal doings resulting from that struggle (unless one of the gods is the god of fate/destiny, in which case they support him); but whe
n
 a single god is pursuing a goal and mortal beings are trying to oppose him, these priests work on behalf of the god and against the mortals. This takes place even when the god is evil; these priests take the side of gods against mortals regardless of the
 god's motives. In short, this is a very strange priesthood, one that is philosophical but joyless.

l Men and Women, all of whom have the Veterinarian nonweapon proficiency. (This proficiency doesn't appear in the}{\i\fs24  Player's Handbook}{\fs24 
. It is identical to the Healing proficiency, except it can only be used to heal animals and monsters.) The priest may take th
e following on adventures: One priest and two rangers of his choice. The priesthood will pay for half of the cost of stronghold construction at 9th level. The stronghold can be built in a city or in the wilderness, but must work principally to protect the
 
animal-life of the surrounding wilderness. (This does not mean to stop hunters if the hunting is carried out at a level that does not threaten the animal population. But any factor which does endanger animal species -- such as drought, excess hunting, def
orestation, etc. -- will bring on the wrath of the priesthood.)
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Possible Symbols:}{\fs24  Bow and arrow crossed.

\par \tab  
\par \tab This god brings revenge on those who deserve it, rights wrongs, punishes the wicked, and avenges those who cannot avenge themselves.
\par \tab Normally, the god acts through his priests. Pries
ts of this god are approached by those who have been wronged, and must learn what they can of the situation, decide who's right and who's wrong, and take steps to punish the guilty party. They must make the punishment fit the crime (a theft does not warra
nt the killing of the thief in most cases, for instance). 
\par \tab Since these priests are often approached to punish those whom ordinary laws can't touch (for instance, to punish a rich man who can bribe his way out of any charge or punishment), they frequently h
ave to perform their missions secretly, so that the local authorities cannot learn of them. These vigilante priests are not appreciated by local governments.
\par \tab Lesser gods of this attribute could be devoted to only one kind of crime or revenge. One might be
 the god of the Revenge of Spurned Lovers. One might be a god of Lawful Trials, and must always go through the legal system. One might be the god who punishes those who forswear themselves, and another a god who punishes those who kill their own kin.

\par \tab The deity of revenge is more likely to be female than male.
\par \tab The priests of this god are on good terms with the priests of Competition, Death, Fire, and War. (Individual DMs might consider this priesthood to belong to Good or Evil camps. But Good sects con
sider this one to be too "tainted" to be truly good, while Evil sects don't like the fact that this sect punishes the wicked.) The priests of this god dislike the priests of Peace.

\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Other Limitations:}{\fs24  Priests of this god may not refuse to investigate when the story of an injustice is brought to them (unless they've already investigated this same compla
int). To do so is to constitute a "betrayal of goals" from the "Priests and Punishment" section of the "Role-Playing" chapter. To investigate, find that there has been an injustice, and then to refuse to act on it is a similar betrayal. However, it is not
 a betrayal to discover an injustice and then take the time to make sure the priest has enough influence and force to effect revenge; he does not have to effect revenge }{\i\fs24 immediately}{\fs24 .

is the primary force, fertility and death are part of the overall cycle. Therefore, if the DM has gods of death and fertility in his campaign, he may not have this cycle; if he has this cycle, he may not have those gods.
\par \tab Followers of this force believe th
at living things are born, live, and die, and then reincarnate in a continuing cycle. Perhaps the cycle is endless; perhaps its purpose is to give the soul of the living thing enough experience that he can achieve a greater level of being.
\par \tab In campaigns wh
ere this cycle does exist, it provides enough magical energy for its priests to cast spells. The priests' duties include education of the flock in the beliefs of the cycle, comforting the flock with the knowledge that death is merely a point in the cycle 
and not the end, and protection of the world from forces which might disrupt the cycle. Because undead beings have been removed or removed themselves from this natural cycle, the priests are their sworn enemies.

\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Combining Traits in One Priesthood}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab It may be that one god has several different attributes. In real-world mythologies, many, many gods possessed many different traits all at the same time.
\par \tab Which leads to the question: When one god possesses several attributes, which priest class do you use for his priests?
\par \tab There are two ways to answer that.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Multiple Priest Classes
\par }{\fs24 \tab  
\par \tab One way to do this is to let the god simultaneously have several appropriate priesthoods. They would actually constitute a single "priesthood" with several different "orders" in it, each order dedicated primarily to one of the god's attributes.

\par \tab That way, 
if a specific god (let's call him Kyros the Storm-Shaker) is a god of both War and Sky, two characters becoming his priests could do so in different ways. One character can become a priest of the war-god; another is a priest of the sky-god. But they belon
g to the priesthood of Kyros, each serving the god in a different way.
\par \tab Let's take an example from real-world mythology. In Greek myth, the god Zeus was a deity of many, many different attributes. These were some of those attributes:
\par \tab   
\par \tab Fertility
\par \tab Lightning
\par \tab Oracles/Prophecy
\par \tab Rulership/Kingship
\par \tab Sky/Weather
\par \tab Strength
\par \tab Wisdom
\par \tab   
\par \tab Therefore, in a campaign where Zeus is a god, a character created to be a priest of Zeus could be any one of those seven types of priests.
\par \tab In your own campaign, you can define any god as having two or more attributes, and therefore two or more different classes of priests can serve that god.
\par \tab That's the simple way to do this.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Revised Priest Classes}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab The hard way to do this is to create an entirely new priest-class. Use the Faith Design Sheet from the previous chapter to work such a thing up.
\par \tab First, look over the priest class rules for all the classes related to the attributes you want the god to contain. Then, choose the elements from each you like. Remember to balance your
 choices of the priest's combat abilities with those of his available spheres of influence so that he will not end up significantly stronger or weaker than any other priest class.
\par \tab Let's create such a class as an example. Let's say the goddess Melebeth is 
the goddess of Love, but in the city of Askarth she is also the civic deity and is known as "The Girder-On" because she is said to arm the city's warriors for combat; she is therefore a goddess of Love, Community, and War. What does her priesthood look li
ke?
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 Alignment}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab The goddess of Community is probably true neutral, but may be of any alignment. The goddess of Love is any sort of good alignment, and the goddess of War is any sort of Neutral alignment. Therefore, our combined Community/Love/War godd
ess averages out to be neutral good. Her priests should also be neutral good.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 Minimum Ability Scores}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab 
The goddess of Community requires W10, Ch12. The goddess of Love requires W10, Ch13. The goddess of War requires W9, S13. Wisdom and Charisma are obviously the leaders here; the priests of this goddess must have Wisdom 10, Charisma 13, and receive +5% exp
erience if either ability is 16 or better, or +10% if both abilities are 16 or better.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 Races Allowed}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab None of the three priest classes (Community, Love, War) excludes any race. Therefore, this combined class allows priests who are dwarves, elves, gnomes, half-elves, halflings, and humans.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 Nonweapon and Weapon Proficiencies
\par }{\fs24 \tab  
\par \tab Community requires Local History. Love requires Herbalism. War requires Blind-Fighting. None of these seems to apply especially appropriately to this combined goddess; since
 she was originally a goddess of Love, with the other attributes added in this one city, the default should be Herbalism.
\par \tab Taking the most appropriate Nonweapon Proficiencies Recommended, we get Heraldry, Reading/Writing, Religion, Riding Land-Based, Healing, Blind-Fighting, and Local History.
\par \tab Most of the three original classes require no specific Weapon Proficiencies, so we'll follow that pattern here.
\par \tab Nonweapon Proficiency Group Crossovers are obviously Priest, General, and Warrior.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 Duties of the Priest}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab Taking the duties from the three types of priesthoods which are most appropriate to this combined class, we get:
\par \tab Guidance, Marriage.
\par \tab Education in the history of the city.
\par \tab Vigilance: Trying to preserve the opportunities for romantic love-matches and marriages in the community, but also recommending marriages which will ally strong families and benefit the city.  
\par \tab Missions of defense when the city is threatened by attackers.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 Weapon and Armor Restrictions}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab The Community goddess' priests can
 use dagger and knife, and two weapons representing the city. The Love goddess' priests can use bow (small), club, lasso, mancatcher, and net. The War goddess' priests can use battle axe, dagger/dirk, knife, lance, mace, maul, polearm, spear, swords (all)
, warhammer.
\par \tab These are three pretty incompatible sets of permitted weapons. But since this combined-attribute goddess will be using weapons mainly to defend her city, we can eliminate the comparatively weak weapons of the pure love-goddess; let us settle o
n the weapons of the Community goddess' priesthood. This will include dagger and knife, and (for the city of Ashkarth) bows (any) and long sword.
\par \tab As for armor: The Community goddess' priests could use all armor and shields, the Love Goddess' priests could
 use no armor or shields, and the War Goddess' priests could use all armor and shields. It sounds, by weight of numbers, as though the priests should be able to use all armor and shields. Between the superior armor and the two good weapons they can use, t
hese priests have Good combat abilities. This means they will have very limited magic.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 Other Limitations}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab Priests of the civic goddess must always wear priestly garments in public; priests of the love goddess get four-sided hit dice and must be wed by the time they reach 8th level; priests of the war-goddess have no other limitations.
\par \tab The combined-goddess' priests should retain the limitation of wearing priestly garments whenever they're in public; these priests are still priests of a civic deity, after all.  
\par \tab And since the goddess is still a deity of love, the marriage restriction should remain.
\par \tab But since this goddess is a fighter, let's drop the four-sided hit dice limitation; priests of this priesthood receive eight-sided hit dice like most fighting priests.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 Spheres of Influence}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab The priests of the community-goddess get: Major Access to All, Creation, Healing. Minor Access to Combat, Protection.
\par \tab The priests of the love-goddess get: Major Access to All, Animal, Charm, Healing, Necromantic, Protection, Summoning. Minor Access to Creation, Divination, Guardian, Plant, Sun, and Weather.
\par \tab The priests of the war-goddess get: Major Access to Combat, Healing. Minor Access to Necromantic, Protection.
\par \tab Since this priesthood, as we decided above, has Good Combat Abilities, the priesthood will have Major Access to the All sphere and two other spheres, and Minor Access to two spheres. Let's choose the most appropriate ones. 
\par \tab   Therefore, the priests of this combined-trait goddess get: Major Access to All, Charm, Healing. Minor Access to Combat, Protection.  
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 Powers}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab Priests of the community-goddess get }{\i\fs24 Incite Berserker Rage, Soothing Word,}{\fs24  and}{\i\fs24  Turn Undead}{\fs24 .
\par \tab Priests of the love-goddess get }{\i\fs24 Charm/Fascination}{\fs24 ,}{\i\fs24  Incite Berserker Rage, Inspire Fear}{\fs24 , }{\i\fs24 Soothing Word}{\fs24 , and }{\i\fs24 Turn Undead}{\fs24 
; these priests received extra powers partly because they had only four-sided hit dice, a condition that the priests of this combined goddess do not share.
\par \tab Priests of the war-goddess get }{\i\fs24 Incite Berserker Rage}{\fs24 ; }{\i\fs24 At 5th level: Inspire Fear}{\fs24 .
\par \tab Taking the common threads from these three goddesses, we decide that priests of the combined-attribute goddess receive:
\par \tab }{\i\fs24 Incite Berserker Rage}{\fs24 ,}{\i\fs24  Turn Undead,}{\fs24  and, at }{\i\fs24 5th level, Inspire Fear}{\fs24 .
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 Followers and Strongholds}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab The goddesses of Community and Love both get their followers at 7th level, the goddess of War at 8th, so we'll settle on 7th level, and also at 7th level the priesthood will pay for half of the stronghold constructions.
\par \tab The goddess of community gets 15 levels of priests and 15 levels of fighters.
\par \tab The goddess of love gets 15 levels of priests, five levels of mage/consultants, five levels of fighter/guards, and five levels of Normal Men and Women with appropriate Nonweapon Proficiencies.  
\par \tab The goddess of war gets 20 levels of priests and 10 levels of fighter/guards.
\par \tab Averaging this out somewhat, the priest of our combined-aspect goddess should get 15 levels of priests (three third-level priests and six first-level priests), 10 levels of fighters (two third-level fighters and four first-level fighters to 
act as guards), and five levels of mage/consultants (one third-level mage and two first-level mages). On adventures, he can take three priests (as usual, only one can be third-level; the remaining two third-level priests run the temple in the character's 
absence), three fighters (ditto), and one mage of his choice.
\par \tab   
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Multi-Class Characters}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab It's possible for demihumans to be multi-class combinations including the priest character classes above.
\par \tab On the chart of the }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook}{\fs24 , page 44, showing the possible multi-class combinations, substitute the word "priest" wherever you see "cleric." Those are the possible combinations.
\par \tab The only limit the character possesses on which type of priest he may be is the racial limitation posed for each priest-
class above. If a priest-class says that elves can't belong to it, then obviously an elf can't be a multi-class fighter/priest of that type of priesthood.
\par \tab Multi-class priest characters follow all the rules for multi-class characters, from pages 44 and 45 of the}{\i\fs24  Player's Handbook}{\fs24 .
\par \tab  
\par }{\b\fs32\cf2 Priest Kits}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab In the last chapter, you were confronted with over sixty different priest character classes to choose from. Certainly, that range of choices will make it easy for your to individualize your priest character -- to 
make him different from the rest of the campaign's clerics.
\par \tab In this chapter, we'll make that even easier.
\par \tab You can further customize your priest by taking a }{\i\fs24 priest kit}{\fs24  for him. A }{\i\fs24 kit }{\fs24 is a collection of skills, proficiencies, restrictions, benefits and hin
drances which give the priest more background and personality, further define his role in the campaign and in the campaign's cultures, and give him advantages and disadvantages to make him more colorful.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Kits and the Priest Classes}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab A kit is more of a cultural description than anything else. Therefore,}{\i\fs24  most}{\fs24  kits are allowed to priests of }{\i\fs24 most}{\fs24 
 faiths. There are exceptions, of course; for example, a priest of the god of Peace may not take the Fighting-Monk kit. Wherever such an exception occurs, it will be mentioned in the text.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Kits and Character Creation}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab No priest character }{\i\fs24 has }{\fs24 to take any priest-kit. It's not necessary, it's not required: It's just a way of adding detail to the character.
\par \tab A priest character may only take one priest-kit. He should take it when he is first created. In campaigns which began before you got }{\i\fs24 The Complete Priest Handbook}{\fs24 
, the DM should allow characters to take priest-kits, but only ones which are appropriate to th
e characters' actions and deeds so far. (For example, if a character has been a perfectly ordinary priest until now, he should not take the Outlaw Priest kit; it's not appropriate.)
\par \tab Once a character has taken a Priest Kit, he cannot change it to another Priest Kit. He can, however, eventually}{\i\fs24  abandon}{\fs24 
 it (see "Abandoning Kits" later in this chapter); having abandoned a kit, he will not be able to take another one.
\par \tab If you want to inject the choice of the Priest Kit into the character creation process, you'll first want to determine your character's Ability Scores ( }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook}{\fs24 
 Chapter 1), Race (Chapter 2), Class (Cleric or Druid from Chapter 3 of the }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook}{\fs24 , or one of the priest classes from the previous chapter of this book), and Alignment (Chapter 4). 
\par \tab It's at this point that you choose your priest kit.
\par \tab After that's done, and the information recorded on your character sheet, you can proceed to Proficiencies (Chapter 5), Money and Equipment (Chapter 6), etc.
\par \tab   
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 The Priest Kits}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab Each priest kit consists of the following elements:
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Description:}{\fs24  This paragraph talks about what this type of priest is to the culture. It also lists any requirements necessary for the character to take the kit; for instance, to be a Savage Priest, the ch
aracter must have been born among or adopted by a savage tribe.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Barred:}{\fs24  This paragraph details which priest classes (plus cleric and druid) may }{\i\fs24 not}{\fs24  take this priest kit.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Role:}{\fs24  This kit describes the role of this priest in his society and campaign. For example, an Outlaw Priest of the God of Love would have a very different campaign role than the Amazon Priestess of the same god.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Secondary Skills:}{\fs24  If you're using the Secondary Skills rules from the AD&D\'ae 2nd Edition game rule books, then your kit may requ
ire your priest to take a specific skill instead of choosing or random-rolling his Secondary Skill. However, even more so than }{\i\fs24 in The Complete Fighter's Handbook}{\fs24 
, we're recommending that you use the Weapon and Nonweapon Proficiency rules instead of the Secondary Skill rules.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Weapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24 
 The priest-kit could require the priest to take a specific weapon proficiency. This is one of the factors that makes it impossible for some priest classes to take some priest kits; obviously, no priest class which
 cannot use a weapon required by a kit could take that kit.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Nonweapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24  A given priest kit may require the priest to have a specific nonweapon proficiencies; however, unlike the situation above with Weapon Proficiencies, these are }{\i\fs24 bonuses}{\fs24 . If
 a kit requires that the character know Riding (Horse), then the character gets that proficiency free, above and beyond the slots he is normally granted. Some proficiencies might be granted from other than the Priest or General groups, but this doesn't ma
tter; if a proficiency is given free, then it is free.
\par \tab If the Priest Kit grants a proficiency that the priest has already had granted to him because of his specific priesthood, the character, instead of receiving that proficiency again, receives one extra 
free nonweapon proficiency slot which he may spend as he pleases.
\par \tab Some proficiencies will merely be recommended, not required. When this is the case, the proficiency is}{\i\fs24  not}{\fs24  given to the character, and the character doesn't have to take it if he doesn't wa
nt to. If the character decides to take this nonweapon proficiency, he uses up the appropriate number of his available nonweapon proficiency slots.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Equipment:}{\fs24  Some priest kits limit the way their priests acquire or use certain types of equipment; when there is such a limitation, this paragraph will deal with it.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Special Benefits:}{\fs24  Most priest kits include special benefits that the priest-character receives. Often, they're defined as special reaction bonuses among certain classes of society, special rights in certain cultures, etc.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Special Hindrances:}{\fs24  Likewise, each priest kit carries certain disadvantages which hinder the priest. Outlaw priests are sought by their own orders and perhaps the authorities, for example.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Wealth Options:}{\fs24  Some priest kits have s
pecial rules regarding their wealth. Generally, these rules don't affect the amount of gold he'll have when he is created (with all clerics and priests, this amounts to 3d6x10gp). However, different priest-kits have variations on the way the money is to b
e spent. Some insist that it all be spent at the beginning, and the remainder of starting gold returned to the priest's superiors. Others let the priest "keep the change;" still others have limits on the amount that can be spent initially.  
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Races: }{\fs24 If a particular priest-kit discriminates among the demihuman races (for example, if an elf can't take a specific kit), that will be noted here.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 DM Choices}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab Before allowing his players to choose kits for their priests, the DM should look over the priest-kits and make some decisions.
\par \tab For each Priest Kit, the DM has to choose:
\par \tab (1) If he will even allow this Kit in his campaign. (It could be that the kit is inappropriate. If there are no Amazons in his world, he shouldn't allow the Amazon priest-kit.)
\par \tab (2) What additional information he needs to give the players about each Kit. (DMs will probably want to elaborate on the priest-kits to fit them better into his campaign.)
\par \tab (3) What changes he might wish to make to each Kit. (If, for example, our conception of the Barbarian doesn't match the DM's, he might wish to change the benefits, hindrances, or other factors to match his conception.)
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 An Important Note}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab Several Priest Kits get reaction bonuses and penalties as part of their Special Benefits and Special Hindrances.
\par \tab In the AD&D\'aegame, when a character has a very high or low charisma, he gets what is called a "reaction adjustment." (See the }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook}{\fs24 
, page 18.) When the character has a high charisma and receives a bonus, it's expressed as a plus: For example, +2. When he has a low charisma and receives a penalty, it's expressed as a minus: For instance, -3.  
\par \tab But here's a special warning: When you roll the 2d10 for Encounter Reactions (see the }{\i\fs24 Dungeon Master's Guide}{\fs24 , page 103, }{\i\fs24 don't add the bonus}{\fs24  (+)}{\i\fs24  or subtract the penalty}{\fs24 
 (-) from the die roll. Do it the other way around: Subtract the bonus (+) and add the penalty (-). If the character has a Charisma of 16, and thus gets a +5 reaction adjustment, you }{\i\fs24 subtract}{\fs24 
 that number from the 2d10 die roll. Otherwise the more charismatic or appealing a PC is, the more vigorously all the NPCs and monsters would dislike him!
\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 
\par Amazon Priestess}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab  }{\b\fs24 Description: }{\fs24 Amaz
ons are women warriors in a world where most cultures are male-dominated or ruled more or less equally by men and women. The Amazon civilization is different from the cultures of the rest of the world in that women occupy all the most important occupation
s
 and positions in their society; men are either second-class citizens, or are all kept as slaves, or are exiled from the culture altogether. Amazons continually have to defend themselves from the efforts of surrounding civilizations to "return them to nor
mal," and therefore they are very good at war.
\par \tab Such civilizations often have one or two specific patron gods. (The deity does not have to be female; in classical mythology, for instance, the Amazons' patron was Ares, the very male god of war.)
\par \tab The prieste
sses of this god interpret the god's will for the Amazons, fight alongside them in times of combat, perform the usual service of guidance (and even marriage, if this is still a function of this specific Amazon society); and sometimes travel through the ou
ter world in an effort to learn what they can of the world of men--in order to protect themselves from it, or to educate themselves and the outer-worlders to reduce misunderstandings between the cultures.
\par \tab There are no special ability-score requirements to be an Amazon.
\par \tab To abandon this kit, the character would have to renounce her Amazon citizenship... meaning that she would have to identify herself more strongly with another culture.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Barred:}{\fs24  The DM will decide which gods act as patrons for the Amazon civilization; most Amazon priestesses will serve those specific gods. However, not all Amazon priestesses }{\i\fs24 have}{\fs24 
 to serve those specific gods. An Amazon culture could have as its patron the gods of War and Moon, for instance, but a specific Amazon priestess coul
d serve another god. (Since each attribute has its own role to play in any civilization, few gods are really inappropriate.) Note, though, that no Amazon priestess can serve the gods of Disease or Peace. Also, since Amazon warriors must know the use of th
e spear and long bow, an Amazon priestess who cannot use those weapons will be looked down upon, and won't command the respect of priestesses who can. Therefore, an Amazon will command less respect }{\i\fs24 
unless she is a priestess of one of the following gods}{\fs24 : Community, Competition, Elemental Forces, Good, Hunting, Light, Mischief/Trickery, Moon, Oracles/Prophecy, Race (Human), Sky/Weather, Sun, War, Wind, Wisdom.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Role:}{\fs24  Among the Amazons, the priestess-types listed immediately above are as highly-regarded as the 
warrior, and the warrior is the most-admired type of Amazon. Outside the Amazon lands, among male-dominated civilizations, the priestess is looked on as an even more unnatural sort of unnatural woman. In cultures where men and women are approximately equa
l in influence, the Amazon is looked on as a curiosity, and may even (at the DM's discretion) be looked down on as a representative of a race that hasn't yet come to the conclusion that neither gender should oppress the other.
\par \tab Among player-character advent
urers, the Amazon-priestess is likely to prove herself to be a doughty fighter and an effective spellcaster. If the priestess character starts out suffering a bit of discrimination when she's introduced into the campaign, that may be normal according to t
h
e culture but the DM shouldn't encourage this attitude, especially after she's proven herself in dangerous situations. Even if the campaign's main culture is discriminatory, the PCs should demonstrate a little more flexibility in their attitudes based on 
their adventuring experiences.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Secondary Skills:}{\fs24  Required: Groom.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Weapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24  Required: None. Recommended: Spear, long bow; if possible, various axes and swords.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Nonweapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24  Bonus Proficiencies: Riding (Land-Based), Animal Training. Recommended: (General) Animal Handling, (Warrior) Animal Lore, Armorer, Bowyer/Fletcher, Hunting, Running, Survival, Tracking.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Equipment: }{\fs24 When an Amazon character is first created, she must buy her armor from among the following choices only: Shield, le
ather, padded, studded leather, brigandine, scale mail, hide, banded mail, bronze plate mail. Once she has adventured elsewhere in the world, she may purchase other types of armor according to her priest-class limitations.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Special Benefits:}{\fs24  Male opponents
 from cultures where women fighters tend to be rare will be amused, rather than cautious, the first time they confront an Amazon. Therefore, in a fight where such a warrior runs up against an Amazon for the first time, the Amazon gets a +3 to hit and +3 d
amage on her}{\i\fs24  first blow only.}{\fs24  This reflects the fact that her opponent's guard is down. \tab 
\par \tab This bonus doesn't work on any Warrior character of fifth level or higher, or a character of any other class at 8th level or higher; in spite of any prejudices he mig
ht bear, this character is too seasoned an adventurer to let his guard down that way.
\par \tab At the DM's discretion, he can give a wary, suspicious NPC an Intelligence check; on a successful check, he will see the attack coming and deny the Amazon the bonus.  
\par \tab 
The bonus won't work on any male fighter who comes from a culture where women do regularly fight, or who has had fighting-women comrades or faced fighting-women opponents before, or even who has seen the Amazon hit someone else with this bonus earlier.

\par \tab It doesn't work on player-characters unless the player is role-playing honestly enough to admit that his character would underestimate the Amazon.
\par \tab Once the Amazon hits a character with this bonus, the target (if he survives) will never fall for it again. It
 can only be used successfully once per victim, ever. But if the Amazon misses a target with this blow, she continues to receive it against this target until she hits him once.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Special Hindrances:}{\fs24  The Amazon receives a -3 reaction roll adjustment from NPC
s from male-dominated societies. Player-characters do not have to demonstrate this hostility unless they want to do so for role-playing purposes, and even then it should fade as they come to respect her.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Wealth Options:}{\fs24  The Amazon gets the ordinary 3d6x10 gp as starting money.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Races:}{\fs24  None are excluded. Humans, elvish, and half-elvish Amazons are most appropriate. Dwarves would substitute battle axe and warhammer for their weapons and swine for their preferred mounts. Gn
omes would substitute throwing axe and short sword, and would ride ponies, and would have Tracking and Survival as their Bonus Nonweapon Proficiencies. Halflings would substitute javelin and sling for their weapons, and Endurance and Set Snares for their 
Bonus Nonweapon Proficiencies.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 Barbarian/Berserker Priest}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Description:}{\fs24  This priest is the priest of a culture halfway between what we think of as civilized and savage. His people live at the very edge of or beyond the borders of the edges of the c
ampaign's main civilization. They tend to be very warlike, fighting battles with neighboring tribes and with intruding imperial troops. Their fighters aren't soldiers; they are warriors, and tend to be deadlier in one-on-one fighting but poorer at formati
on combat than those of the "civilized" nations. These warriors may, in fact, be berserkers (see }{\i\fs24 The Complete Fighter Handbook}{\fs24 
). They are still more in touch with nature and the world than the people of civilized lands. They may have very different customs from civilized folk.
\par \tab Priests of this community perform the same functions as priests of civilized lands. However, barbarians have more respect for the gods than civilized folk, and priests also are well-respected. Kings and war-chiefs of their culture lis
ten to their counsel. In their culture, those who disagree with them do not insult them or their guidance, and it is forbidden for a warrior to attack a priest of his culture (though defending himself from attack is all right... if he can prove that it wa
s defense, not aggression).
\par \tab There are no ability requirements to be a priest of a barbarian or berserker tribe. The warriors of the tribe must have Strength 15, and priests will be most impressive if they can approximate or match that score... but it's not
 a requirement of the kit.
\par \tab As with the Amazon, abandonment of this kit means that the character renounces his allegiance to his tribe or clan and accepts citizenship in some other culture. This means that he must now perform his priestly duties in the fas
hion of the priests of that culture.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Barred:}{\fs24  Barbarian tribes tend to have one or two patron gods, and most of their priests will serve those gods. These tend to be gods of natural forces (Agriculture, Animals, Darkness/Night, Earth, Elemental Forces, Fer
tility, Hunting, Lightning, Metalwork, Nature, Sky/Weather, Thunder) or other barbarian attributes (Strength, War). Gods of the "softer" attributes (Arts, Love, Music, etc.) would be represented but their priests would be much rarer. No priesthood is barr
ed among the barbarians, however scarce.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Role:}{\fs24  In the campaign, the barbarian priest is a spooky, dangerous figure. Like barbarian warriors, he'll be grim and a little alien to his allies from civilized lands. First and foremost, he's a defender of his peo
ple, and he'll most often be found wandering in lands other than his own because of some quest set him by the gods or some mystery he's encountered that requires him to travel in order to solve it. When he finds his own tribesmen captured or enslaved in t
h
e outer world, which might be a common occurrence, he must do his utmost to free them and return them to his own land, which can imperil other goals he and his player-character allies have . . .  but as a leader and protector of his culture, this is a dut
y he cannot refuse. (If he were to do so, the god would take it as a betrayal of goals; see the Role-Playing chapter.)
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Secondary Skills:}{\fs24  The main occupation of the barbarian's tribe determines what sort of secondary skill he knows. If the tribe raises and 
sells horses, then the Groom secondary skill will be known by all tribesmen. Ask the DM what the tribe's main occupation is and that will determine the required Secondary Skill.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Weapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24  Required: None. Recommended: Battle axe, sword/bastard, bow (any), sling, warhammer. Naturally, the priesthood may limit the priest's choice of weapons and not allow him to learn all these.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Nonweapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24  Bonus Proficiency: Endurance. Recommended: (General) Animal Handling, Animal Training, Directio
n Sense, Fire-Building, Riding (Land-Based), Weather Sense, Blind-Fighting, Hunting, Mountaineering, Running, Set Snares, Survival, Tracking, Herbalism, Jumping. (Some of these are outside the priest's Nonweapon Proficiency Group Crossovers and will cost 
twice the listed slots if taken; see the description of the priest class, and the chart at the bottom of the }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook}{\fs24 
, page 55, for more details.) The DM may require this priest to take a proficiency in the tribal specialty (Fishing, Agriculture, etc.).
\par \tab   }{\b\fs24 Equipment:}{\fs24 
 With his starting gold, the barbarian priest cannot buy armor heavier than splint mail, banded mail, or bronze plate mail. Once he has adventured in the outer world, he can buy any type of armor his priestly requirements allow him to us
e. With his starting gold, he can buy only weapons appropriate to his tribe (usually battle axe, bows, club, dagger/dirk, footman's flail, mace, or pick, hand/throwing axe, sling, spear, and swords); naturally, priestly restrictions may prevent him from t
aking some of these, depending on which god he serves.  
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Special Benefits:}{\fs24  Barbarians are imposing and dangerous-looking. This tends to make others respect them or at least wish not to make enemies of them. Therefore, barbarian/berserker priests receive a 
+1 reaction adjustment bonus when encountering NPCs. This becomes a +3 among members of his own culture.
\par \tab If the priest's culture has many Berserker warriors, as per }{\i\fs24 The Complete Fighter's Handbook}{\fs24 , the priest has an additional special ability. Berserkers 
normally take ten rounds to go berserk; in the presence of one of their own priests, then can do it in five. Additionally, if the priest, as part of his priestly class, has the }{\i\fs24 incite berserker rage}{\fs24 
 granted power, then berserkers of his culture in his presence can go berserk in }{\i\fs24 one round}{\fs24 . The priest is not required to use his power for this to take place; it just happens.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Special Hindrances:}{\fs24  The barbarian/berserker priest has a problem in civilized lands: He doesn't respect the authorities and they have le
arned to be cautious of him. (This sort of priest keeps freeing his enslaved brethren, and, even if he worships a god known to this culture, he does so in a different way that the locals consider wrong.) Therefore, the barbarian/berserker priest receives 
a -3 reaction adjustment penalty when encountering NPCs in positions of power: Rulers, government officials, etc.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Wealth Options:}{\fs24  No special requirements; this priest gets the usual 3d6x10 gp as starting money.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Races:}{\fs24  There are no special restrictions here. Each individual DM has to decide whether or not his demihumans can live in what are considered barbarian cultures. If they can, then they will have priests among them.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 Fighting-Monk}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Description:}{\fs24  This priest belongs to an order devoted in large p
art to the study of fighting styles, especially barehanded martial arts. These monks live and study in monasteries devoted to their orders. If, for example, they are priests of the god of War, these monks do not live and study in ordinary temples of that 
god; they have their own secluded monastery away from the normal temples.  
\par \tab These monks do not confine their war-training to the monasteries, however. They travel the wide world in order to learn the secrets of life, the world, magic and the gods. As an or
der, they sometimes volunteer their services to rulers in times of war, and act as elite forces against the enemy.
\par \tab These monks are most appropriate for an oriental-flavored campaign and the DM may wish to decide that they cannot be used in his campaign. B
efore you create a Fighting-Monk character, consult your DM and ask if he is allowing the Fighting-Monk kit in his campaign.
\par \tab In order to be a fighting-monk, the character must have a Dexterity of 12 or more.
\par \tab If a fighting-monk wants to abandon this kit, 
he must go through a difficult process in order to do so. He must not use any of his unarmed combat techniques for three whole experience levels' worth of time. Once he's reached that third experience level, he has forgotten his unarmed combat techniques 
and may resume the wearing of armor; and, if he renounced some of his spheres of influence when he became a fighting-monk, may now resume those lost spheres. 
\par \tab 
As an example, a fighting-monk priest at 5th level decides to renounce his allegiance to the fighting-monk order. He adventures normally, still not wearing armor but otherwise performing as a normal priest of his priest-class. He abstains from using his u
narmed combat techniques. At 8th level, he has abandoned his fighting techniques and may once again wear the armor appropriate to his priest-class.
\par \tab If a character forgets himself and uses unarmed combat techniques during this process, he must "start over." It will be three experience levels from his }{\i\fs24 current}{\fs24 
 level, from the time he made the slip, until he can resume his priest-class.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Barred:}{\fs24  A priest of any priesthood which starts out with Poor Fighting Abilities is barred from this choice.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Role:}{\fs24  In the ca
mpaign, this priest is the philosophical warrior whose principal duty is self-enlightenment. He is less concerned with the ordinary priestly duties (such as guidance, marriage, community service) than those priests, but will still perform them; he just wo
n
't go out of his way to look for them, nor will he normally volunteer for them (NPCs must ask his help in these matters). Such characters are usually wanderers, which help make them appropriate for adventuring parties. They do periodically return to their
 monasteries, to pass on the learning they have acquired on the road, and to brush up on their fighting-skills; the rest of the time they spend out in the world.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Secondary Skills:}{\fs24  This priest may choose or random-roll his secondary skill, if you are using the secondary skills system in addition to the weapon/nonweapon proficiencies system.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Weapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24  Required: See under "Special Benefits," below. Otherwise, the priest may take any weapon proficiencies which his specific priest class allows him; he may not take any the class does not allow him.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Nonweapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24  Bonus Proficiency: Tumbling. Recommended: Riding (Land-Based), Artistic Ability (any), Dancing, Reading/Writing, Religion.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Equipment: }{\fs24 See "Special Hindrances," below.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Special Benefits:}{\fs24  The principal benefit of being a Fighting-Monk is that the character receives }{\i\fs24 two free weapon proficiency slots}{\fs24 
 which he must use to take Specialization in one of the three styles of Unarmed Combat (Punching, Wrestling, or Martial Arts). These were described in greater detail in }{\i\fs24 The Complete Fighter's Handbook}{\fs24 
, but that information also appears here, in the "Equipment and Combat" chapter. The Fighting-Monk is the only priest who can specialize in an Unarmed Combat style. He can specialize in any or a
ll of the three styles, but he may only specialize in one of them at first experience level.
\par \tab As a second benefit, regardless of what it says for the priest's class, the Fighting-Monk has a Nonweapon Proficiency Group Crossover with }{\i\fs24 all five}{\fs24  Proficiency Gr
oups (General, Priest, Rogue, Warrior, Wizard). No proficiency he takes will cost double the usual number of slots.
\par \tab The last of the Fighting-Monk's benefits is this: He doesn't have to spend all his starting Weapon Proficiency slots at first level. He can
 save his unspent proficiencies, and they do not "go away." Later, he can spend them at a rate of one proficiency per experience level to improve his martial arts or buy new martial arts.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Special Hindrances:}{\fs24  This priest cannot wear any sort of armor. Additionally, if he's a priest-class with Medium Combat Abilities, he must "give up" some of his Spheres of Influence. He may have no more than }{\i\fs24 three }{\fs24 
Major Accesses (one of which must be All) and two Minor Accesses. The player may choose from the accesses he currently has which ones the character loses and which he keeps.
\par \tab Additionally, the priest may never own more things (weapons, treasure, money, etc.) than he can carry on his back.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Wealth Options:}{\fs24  The Fighting-Monk gets the usual 3d6x10 gp as starting money.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Races:}{\fs24  No special limitations. Humans, elves and half-elves seem visually more suited to this kit than dwarves, gnomes, and halflings, but the DM can allow those races to take this kit if he so chooses.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 Nobleman Priest}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Description:}{\fs24  This priest 
was a member of a noble family and entered a priesthood. But even as a priest he keeps his opinions about the superiority of the ruling classes and his tastes for the finer things in life; he doesn't abandon his love of good food, good furnishings, comfor
t, the arts, intellectual stimulation, and so forth.
\par \tab The Nobleman Priest prefers the company of nobles and is often appointed as an advisor to a noble family, a ruler, an important local governor, etc. He has less concern for the lives and welfare of commo
ners. When pressed, he will perform any and all priestly duties for commoners, but he usually seeks to avoid these duties; when he is a low-level character, he'll keep himself away from common folk as much as possible in order to avoid these inconvenience
s, and when he is higher-level he will assign a subordinate or a follower to attend their needs.
\par \tab The Nobleman Priest is not necessarily evil or a bad person. In fact, he often adheres to a code of chivalric behavior much like a knight's. But he does have strong social prejudices which color his thinking. 
\par \tab Important note: A nobleman can become a priest and not take the Nobleman Priest kit. This sort of priest lives more frugally, like other priests, and does not have to have a disdain for the lower social c
lasses; Nobleman Priests do not count him among their ranks. 
\par \tab There are no special requirements to be a Nobleman Priest.
\par \tab If a Nobleman Priest player-character ever decides that he is wrong in his attitudes (which can occur in especially dramatic fashion 
if he is affected by the self-sacrifice of a commoner who has saved him, or if he falls in love with a character of the common social classes), he may choose to abandon this kit. If he does this, he will be ostracized by most of the nobles who were previo
u
sly counted as his friends (the DM can have one or two more broad-minded nobles still count him a friend, and the player-characters can make up their own minds on the subject); he may even be exiled from his own family. As with any kit abandonment, he los
es all other benefits and hindrances of the kit.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Barred:}{\fs24  None.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Role}{\fs24 : In the campaign, the Nobleman Priest is an aggravating snob (though he might not be aware of his snobbery). He is a fun role to play, but he'd better have some redeeming features if the 
other PCs are to continue to associate with him. If he does have redeeming features, it's very likely that some PCs will try to "reform" him to their own way of thinking.
\par  \tab }{\b\fs24 Secondary Skills:}{\fs24  Nobleman Priests may choose or random-roll their Secondary Skill.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Weapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24  Required: None. Recommended: Long sword, bastard sword, lance, flails (all), maces (all), if allowed by the priest's actual priest class.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Nonweapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24 
 Bonus Proficiencies: (General) Etiquette, Heraldry, Riding (Land-Based). Recommended: (General) Animal Training, Dancing, (Warrior, double slots unless the priest class has a nonweapon proficiency group crossover including the Warrior group) Gaming, Hunt
ing, (Priest) Local History, Musical Instrument, Reading/Writing.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Equipment:}{\fs24  The Nobleman Priest may spend his gold as he chooses # but he has certain minimum standards he cannot violate. Before starting play, he must buy: 
\par \tab (1) A suit of armor (if he is permitted to by his priest-class . . .  and, unless his class limits him to lesser armor, he cannot buy armor less protective than brigandine or scale mail).
\par \tab (2) At least one weapon larger than a dagger (again, if his priest-class so permits him).
\par \tab (3) A horse (at least a riding horse), riding saddle, bit & bridle, horseshoes and shoeing, halter and saddle blanket.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Special Benefits:}{\fs24  The Nobleman Priest starts with more gold than other priests; see below under Wealth Options.
\par \tab The Nobleman Priest receives a +3 reaction from any noble of his own culture, and a +2 from nobles of other cultures. The DM can ignore this if there is a cultural hatred between those people and the priest's culture or the priest's god.
\par \tab When travelling, he can demand shelter from anyone in his own land; he can demand shelter for two people multiplied by the priest's experience level (if he's eighth level, he can demand shelter for himself and a retinue of fifteen more people).

\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Special Hindrances:}{\fs24  The Nobleman Priest is expected to li
ve well. If he has enough money to do so, he may only buy high-quality goods, and so must spend at least two times the minimum necessary money for anything he buys. If a basic long sword costs 15 gp, he won't buy one worth less than 30 gp; the extra money
 goes into quality, engraving, etc. (He can't save money by having a friend or follower buy cheaper things for him; he's just not satisfied with anything less than good-quality merchandise.)
\par \tab If the priest is broke and cannot spend this extra money, he can 
then settle for lesser goods . . .  but the other nobles of his culture, if they see him with shabby accoutrements, will mock him, and he does not get his reaction bonus until once again all his goods are high-quality goods. In fact, if his gear and posse
s
sions look sufficiently shabby (DM's discretion), people may not believe him to be a nobleman at all, and may refuse him the shelter he could ordinarily demand. (This happens most often if a nobleman priest is robbed of all his clothes and goods and left 
to fend for himself.)
\par \tab As he can demand shelter of others, other Nobleman Priests can demand shelter of him. This can be expensive if they decide to stay for awhile. This is also a good way for the DM to bleed extra money from the priest if he seems to have too much.

\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Wealth Options:}{\fs24 
 The Nobleman Priest begins play with more gold than other priests. He gets 225 gp plus the standard 3d6x10 gp. But he must spend a good portion of that on the Equipment required of him. If the priest abandons this kit, that mone
y doesn't magically "go away," but as part of his social ostracization the character should suffer some sort of financial loss, equal to at least 225 gp, as determined by the DM. (Perhaps a malicious ex-friend destroys some of his property; perhaps a pett
y-minded business acquaintance betrays him on a business deal.) 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Races:}{\fs24  This kit has no special requirements for race. The DM may decide that not all races have the same kind of social snobbery that humans do, in which case that race could not take this kit.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 Outlaw Priest
\par }{\fs24 \tab  
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Description: }{\fs24 This priest has decided to become part of some sort of outlaw community and serve that community's religious needs. The trouble is, for the character to take this kit, this group or community must be sufficiently outla
wed that the priesthood in question does not approve of it. Alternatively, the priest may have decided that the god's priesthood is not serving him in an appropriate way, and he will have decided to create his own priestly order serving the same god. In t
his case, too, the regular priesthood does not approve of him. In either case, the priest must believe that he is still serving the god in a fashion that the god approves of. (The DM, obviously, must agree.)
\par \tab Friar Tuck, the cleric who tended to Robin Hood's Merry Men, is the classic example of this type of priest.
\par \tab This priest, in the pursuit of his duties, is opposed by other priests serving the same god. In addition, if he's identified himself with an outlaw or pirate band, he'll be wanted by the authorities as a member of that band.
\par \tab There are no special ability-score requirements to be an Outlaw Priest.
\par \tab A priest abandons this kit by leaving the outlaw band or opposing/disbanding the new religious order, whichever is pertinent. Additionally, by role-play
ing in the campaign, he must answer all the charges pressed against him by the authorities (he might do this by being tried and going to prison for a time, or paying reparations, or accepting tasks of penance from his temple); if he does not, he will cont
inue to be opposed by his temple and wanted by the authorities.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Barred:}{\fs24  Priests of the gods of Community may not take this kit. Priests of no Philosophy or Force may take this kit. (They can associate themselves with pirate or
 outlaw bands, but there is no censure within their orders because of it, and therefore no disadvantage to belonging to such a band.)
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Role:}{\fs24  This sort of priest has one of two roles, depending on the situation.
\par \tab (1) With the first situation mentioned above
, the priest has joined an outlaw or pirate band. In the campaign, then, he's the rogue priest who has decided that the band deserves his priestly guidance, and that this is more important than the demands of his priestly order. The priest either agrees w
i
th the band's outlaw activities or ignores them; his concern is that they receive the blessings of his god. Perhaps, too, he thinks that they'll be a more ethical group with him around; he may be present to keep them from performing acts of brutality or r
apine, which they might undertake were he not present.
\par \tab (2) In the second situation mentioned above, the priest is a rogue visionary who thinks that he must serve his god in a way not approved of by the normal priesthood. This character is probably someone 
who went through the temple's normal priestly training, decided that there was something wrong or lacking in it, and set out to found his own order. A classic example of this is the situation where a priesthood has become corrupt and lazy, and a reformer 
priest has appeared to try to return the worship of the god to its former honorable state; the corrupt priests naturally wish to maintain the }{\i\fs24 status quo}{\fs24 .
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Secondary Skills:}{\fs24  The priest can choose his own secondary skill. If he's part of a pirate band, he may
 wish to choose Sailor, Shipwright or Navigator. If he's part of a landbound outlaw band, he might choose Forester, Hunter, or Trapper/Furrier. He may decide on none of these and make a decision based on his life before he entered the priesthood.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Weapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24  Required: None. Recommended: If Pirate, cutlass*, belaying pin*, bill. If Outlaw, weapon choices appropriate for the outlaw band. (The "*" symbol refers to weapons introduced in }{\i\fs24 
The Complete Fighter's Handbook}{\fs24 .) 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Nonweapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24  Bonus Proficiency: Religion.
\par \tab Recommended Proficiencies (Pirate Priest): Pirate's Bonus Proficiencies: (General) Rope Use, Seamanship, Swimming, Weather Sense, (Warrior, double slots unless priest-class dictates otherwise) Navigation, (Priest) Engineering (fo
r shipbuilding), Reading/Writing (for mapmaking), (Rogue, double slots unless priest-class dictates otherwise) Appraising, Set Snares (in association with Rope Use skill), Tightrope Walking, Tumbling, (Wizard, double slots unless priest-class dictates oth
erwise) Engineering (for shipbuilding), Reading/Writing (for mapmaking).
\par \tab Recommended Proficiencies (Outlaw Priest): (General) Direction Sense, Fire-Building, Riding (Land-Based), (Warrior, double slots unless priest-class dictates otherwise) Animal Lore, B
owyer/Fletcher, Endurance, Hunting, Running, Set Snares, Survival, Tracking, (Priest) Healing, Herbalism, Local History, (Rogue, double slots unless priest-class dictates otherwise) Disguise.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Equipment:}{\fs24  No restrictions. Within the context of the campaign,
 if this is a pirate or outlaw band, it's a bad idea to wear metal armor (banded, brigandine, bronze plate, chain, field plate, full plate, plate mail, and ring mail). Metal armor drags pirates down to their deaths when they fall overboard; and it's noisy
 when worn by outlaws trying to ambush their prey. But this is just a factor the DM needs to remember, not a restriction on the kit.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Special Benefits:}{\fs24  The main benefit of this kit is that the priest does not have any superiors. He takes orders from no superior religious authority (unless the god himself chooses to issue some). 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Special Hindrances:}{\fs24  The outlaw priest is opposed by the normal priestly order serving his god. When they hear of his plans, they try to thwart them (break up religious meetings, dis
rupt building of his temple, etc.). This priest never gets to build a temple at cut-rate prices; he must always spend the whole amount to build his temple. (If he ever abandons his kit, the regular priesthood may accept his temple as one belonging to the 
p
riesthood, but will never recompense him half the money it took to build it.) If the outlaw priest is part of an outlaw or pirate band, he is sought by the same authorities that seek that band, and will pay the same penalties under the law as they do if h
e is caught. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Wealth Options:}{\fs24  Outlaw priests get the standard 3d6x10 gp for starting gold.

\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 Pacifist Priest}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Description:}{\fs24  This priest is devoted to the cause of peace. He is a champion of passive resistance, of achieving one's ends without resorting to violence of any kind.
\par \tab There are no special requirements to be a priest of this sort. Nor are there special rules for abandonment of the kit, if the character eventually feels that he needs to be wielding force to achieve his ends.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Barred:}{\fs24  Priests of the following gods, forces and philosophies may not be Pacifist Priests: Disease, Evil, Justice/Revenge, War.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Role:}{\fs24  In a campaign, this priest can be a real aggravation to the more combat-oriented player-characters. Therefore, the DM should allow this priest in only the following situations:
\par \tab (1) When he's an NPC, so that the DM doesn't have to work to contrive to keep him with the party all the time (they'll have an easier time of abandoning him if they wish);
\par \tab (2) When he's part of a specific quest or mission (i.e., they must accompany him and guard him throughout the quest or it will automatically fail); or
\par \tab (3) When all the PCs are pacifists (this would be a very unusual campaign or quest, indeed...).
\par \tab Note, though, that 
just because the priest demands peacefulness of all around him, his allies don't have to obey. However, it is inevitable that in combat situations the player of the pacifist priest will feel left out (he can't fight); additionally, he'll feel compelled by
 
his philosophy to argue with the other PCs, to chide them for their violence, which will get on their nerves. Therefore, the DM should keep such quests short, so that the pacifist priest doesn't drive the other characters to the point that they'll kill hi
m.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Secondary Skills:}{\fs24  This priest may choose or random-roll his secondary skill. It may not be Armorer, Hunter, or Trapper/Furrier (if he rolls one of these up randomly, he may re-roll).
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Weapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24  The Pacifist Priest may not know any Weapon Pro
ficiency except bow and dart, and may know them only if his true priest-class allows them. The priest may only use these weapons in competition, as described below under "Special Hindrances." The priest still receives all his Weapon Proficiency slots, and
 if he ever abandons this kit may "spend" them at a rate of two slots every experience level.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Nonweapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24  Bonus Proficiency: Etiquette. Recommended: Languages (Modern), Languages (Ancient), Ancient History, Singing, Musical Instrument, Reading/Writing.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Equipment:}{\fs24  This priest may not buy any armor, and may not buy any weapon except dagger or knife (for eating only), and bow and dart (if he has proficiency with them).
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Special Benefits:}{\fs24  This priest is a very compelling personality. He receives a
 +2 to his Charisma score (his Charisma cannot exceed 18 from this bonus), and, in addition to any reaction bonus that his heightened Charisma gives him, he receives a +2 reaction from anyone who is not utterly opposed to his philosophy. (Beings opposed t
o his philosophy include priests and devoted adherents of the gods, forces and philosophies mentioned above under "Barred," and certain warlike nonhuman races like orcs, ogres and trolls.)  
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Special Hindrances:}{\fs24  This priest may never wear armor, and may never use weapons, spells or any other tactics to harm a human, demihuman, nonhuman, or monster. If he ever violates this decree, his }{\i\fs24 god}{\fs24 
 will not punish him (because the pacifist's oath is one he took for himself, not for his god), but his own guilt will dep
rive him of all magic spells for the span of one month. (If the DM wishes, if the priest is a follower of the god of Peace, the god can instead punish him as a "Betrayal of Goals" from the }{\b\fs24 Role-Playing}{\fs24 
 chapter.) Naturally, if he later abandons the kit, he can resume the wearing of armor and use of weapons according to his priest-class.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Wealth Options:}{\fs24  This priest gets the usual 3d6x10 gp.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Races: }{\fs24 No special limitations.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 Peasant Priest}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Description:}{\fs24 
 The Peasant Priest is the antithesis of the Nobleman Priest above. He's a champion of the common man, and prefers serving the commoner to any association with nobles. He has taken a vow of poverty; he believes he should sacrifice his worldly goods to the
 glory of his deity.
\par \tab Note that the Peasant Priest need not have been born a peasant; he could have been born a nobleman and later abandoned that lifestyle and the privileges of his class.
\par \tab There are no ability-score requirements to be a Peasant Priest.
\par \tab There are no special rules for abandonment of this kit.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Barred:}{\fs24  Priests of the following gods, forces, and philosophies may not take this kit: Evil, Good, Prosperity.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Role:}{\fs24  In the campaign, the Peasant Priest devotes himself to the needs of the common man.
 If he's part of an adventuring party, he won't support any plans which endanger or exploit the peasants or serfs, and will try to recommend plans which advantage them. (For example, if the party wants to use the locals to help lure the dragon out of its 
c
ave, so that the locals will be the first ones flamed and eaten, the priest will object. But if the locals are to be along as support troops, and have information and chances of success and survival at least equal to the player-characters', he won't have 
a
ny such objection.) He'll insist that treasures be shared with the locals of the area where the treasure was found. (Assuming that the treasure is split into even shares among party members, he'll insist that the local peasant community receive two shares
, for example.) In a greedy or tight-fisted party, the party might refuse his requests, which doesn't mean the priest has to attack them or steal from them... but this will inevitably result in the priest becoming disillusioned with the party. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Secondary Skills:}{\fs24  The player may choose his priest's secondary skill.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Weapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24  The player may choose his character's weapon proficiencies, subject to the limitations of the priest's actual priest-class. The DM may insist that the character start out the
 campaign only with proficiencies appropriate to a peasant, such as short sword, spear, bow, footman's weapons and the like; long swords (and bigger blades), horseman's weapons, exotic polearms, lances, tridents and the like are not. This should only be a
 restriction when the character is first created; afterwards, he can learn any weapon his priest-class allows him.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Nonweapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24  Bonus Proficiencies: Agriculture }{\i\fs24 or }{\fs24 Fishing (player choice), Weather Sense }{\i\fs24 or }{\fs24 Animal Lore (player choice). Recommended: Any of the General proficiencies.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Equipment:}{\fs24  The Peasant Priest has restrictions on the way he spends his money. Other than weapons, with which he has no monetary limitation, he may own only one object worth as much as 15 gp, and other than that one o
bject may own nothing worth more than 10 gp. He may never own more than 75 gp worth of (non-weapon) property at any one time. If he receives money or gifts which put him above that limit, he must give away money and possessions until once again he is with
in the 75 gp limitation.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Special Benefits:}{\fs24  The Peasant Priest always has shelter when he's in his own community; his own people will shelter him even from the land's rightful authorities. Among peasants of other communities, he cannot count on this benefit
, but he receives a +2 reaction adjustment from all peasants.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Special Hindrances:}{\fs24  The Peasant Hero's great limitation is described above under "Equipment." 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Wealth Options:}{\fs24  The Peasant Priest gets the standard 3d6x10 gp starting money. Of the money he receives, no more than 75 gp may be spent on goods other than weapons.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Races:}{\fs24  No special limitation.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 Prophet Priest}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Description:}{\fs24  A prophet is one who receives signs, dreams, or clues about the future from his god. Priests of the god of prophecy are prophets, but they aren't the }{\i\fs24 only}{\fs24 
 prophets. Priests of other gods can receive and pass along prophecies. However, since this is rarer, the DM has the right to approve or disapprove any character taking this Priest Kit.
\par \tab To be a Prophet Priest, the character must have a Wisdom of 15 or better.
\par \tab A character may not abandon this kit. As long as he is a priest, he is a Prophet Priest.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Barred:}{\fs24  Priests of the god of Prophecy may not take this kit. All other priests may. (Priests of philosophies or forces don't receive their prophecies from a god; their prophecies are more like psychic impressions.)
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Role:}{\fs24  In the campaign, the Prophet Priest is partly a tool for the DM; the DM can use the character to supply clues and even red herrings to the characters. His is o
ften a thankless job, and he is often a bit alienated from the normal folk (see "Special Hindrances" below).  
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Secondary Skills:}{\fs24  The priest may choose his own secondary skill.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Weapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24  Required: None. Recommended: Any that the priest's actual priest-class permits.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Nonweapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24  Bonus Proficiency: Weather Sense. Recommended: None special.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Equipment:}{\fs24  No special restrictions.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Special Benefits:}{\fs24  The c
haracter receives the Medium Granted Power "Prophecy" from the Designing Faiths chapter. However, it's more limited than the Prophecy which is granted to priests of the god of Prophecy. With this power, priests may receive visions from the god at any time
 the DM decides, but may only deliberately sink into a trance in order to receive a vision once per day.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Special Hindrances:}{\fs24  It's not normal for anyone but priests of the god of Prophecy to be prophets. Therefore, normal people are a little edgy around oth
er prophets, and react to them at a  -2  reaction adjustment. (This adjustment may never result in a reaction worse than Cautious, however.)
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Wealth Options:}{\fs24  This priest receives the normal 3d6x10 gp starting gold.

\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 Savage Priest}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Description:}{\fs24 
 This is a shaman of a savage tribe. This character is a member of the tribe. The tribe itself is a technologically and culturally primitive one (by the standards and in the opinions of more "civilized" cultures), but is also one w
hich is attuned to the natural forces of the world. The Savage Priest interprets the will of his god and acts as an advisor or leader to the members of his tribe.
\par \tab This character might be an animal-totem shaman who assigns all the tribal warriors their ani
mal totems. He might be the witch-doctor who insists on the deaths of the adventurers from the outside world. Take a priestess of a nature-god and give her the Savage Priestess kit, and you end up with something very like a nymph. Whether the Savage Pries
t is good or evil, filthy or clean-limbed depends on the nature of the tribe itself; the DM decides what the tribe is like.
\par \tab To be a Savage Priest, a character must have a minimum Strength score of 11 and a minimum Constitution score of 13.
\par \tab In abandoning t
his kit, the character is renouncing his membership with the tribe and accepting citizenship in some other culture. This frequently happens with Savage Priests who join adventuring parties, stay with them in travels through the world, and learn so much of
 the outside world that they no longer feel like part of their tribe.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Barred:}{\fs24  Priests of the following god and philosophies may not take this kit: Disease, Divinity of Mankind, Evil, Good.
\par \tab Priests of the following gods are }{\i\fs24 most}{\fs24  appropriate to this kit: Animals, Earth, Elemental Forces, Fire, Hunting, Nature, Sky/Weather, Vegetation.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Role:}{\fs24  In a campaign, this character usually plays the role of the primitive who finds his world-view shattered by his experiences in the outer world... but who might teach his
 "civilized" companions something about simple truth and justice as he adventures with them. The DM should insist that the character role-play his tribal origins in the first four or five experience levels, until the character is more used to the outside 
w
orld; this priest will be baffled by "high-technology" inventions (iron and steel weapons, boats made out of more than a single log, hourglasses, anything more sophisticated than the tools of his tribe), by civilized morals and ethics, and especially by t
he strangeness and unfairness of the laws of civilized men.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Secondary Skills:}{\fs24  The Savage Priest character must take Fisher, Forester, Groom, Hunter, or Trapper/Furrier as his Secondary Skill (player choice, based on the activities of his character's tribe).
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Weapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24 
 The Savage Priest is limited to the weapons his actual priest-class permits him, and is further limited (when he is first created) to the following set of proficiencies: blowgun, long bow, short bow, club, dagger, javelin, knife, s
ling, spear. After he has adventured in the outer world, the character may learn other proficiencies.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Nonweapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24  Bonus Proficiencies: (General) Direction Sense }{\i\fs24 or }{\fs24 Weather Sense (player choice), (Warrior) Endurance }{\i\fs24 or}{\fs24  Survival (player choice)
. Recommended: (General) Animal Handling, Animal Training, Fire-Building, Fishing, Riding (Land-based), Rope Use, Swimming, (Warrior, double slots unless the priest-class dictates otherwise) Animal Lore, Bowyer/Fletcher, Hunting, Mountaineering, Running, 
S
et Snares, Tracking, (Priest) Healing, Herbalism, Local History, Religion, (Rogue, double slots unless the priest-class dictates otherwise) Jumping, Tightrope Walking, Tumbling, (Wizard, double slots unless the priest-class dictates otherwise) Herbalism. 
The Savage may }{\i\fs24 not}{\fs24  take Etiquette or Heraldry when first created. 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Equipment:}{\fs24  The Savage Priest, with his starting gold, may buy no armor other than leather armor and shield, and may buy no weapon not listed above under "Weapon Proficiencies." He must spen
d all his gold when he is created, or lose any "change" he has left over.
\par \tab If you have }{\i\fs24 The Complete Fighter's Handbook}{\fs24 , use the Equipment rules for the Savage Warrior Kit instead.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Special Benefits:}{\fs24  The Savage Priest has a special }{\i\fs24 Detect Magic}{\fs24  ability, res
embling the spell of the same name, which he may use once per day per experience level he has (i.e., a 5th-level savage could use his ability five times per day). The rules for this power are:
\par \tab }{\i\fs24 Detect Magic}{\fs24 . The Savage Priest is in tune with nature and can
 feel when there is something magical in the vicinity. As with the first-level Priest spell, he has a 10% chance per experience level to determine the sphere of the magic.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Special Hindrances:}{\fs24  The Savage Priest is imposing and strange, and he worships his 
gods "all wrong" (i.e., civilized folk and priests recognize that his rites are different, unlike theirs). Therefore, he suffers a -2 reaction adjustment from all civilized folk (NPCs, that is; PCs can decide for themselves how they react to him). 
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Wealth Options:}{\fs24  The Savage starts out with only 3d6x5 gp. After the campaign starts, he will encounter money, and the player may decide either that he likes the stuff or rejects it as a stupid city-human idea.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Races: }{\fs24 No special limitations.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs22\cf2 Scholar Priest}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Description:}{\fs24 
 This character is a researcher. He's most at home when he's poring over books, scrolls, papyri, clay tablets and other old writings. He's not forbidden from fighting, but is more likely to try to straighten out a bad situation with reason, 
personal charisma, or even trickery than with a weapon. His life is dedicated to the assimilation of knowledge (and, usually, the transmission of that knowledge to new generations).
\par \tab A scholar priest must have an Intelligence ability score of 13 or better.
\par \tab This kit cannot be abandoned. A scholar can break off correspondence with other scholars, can choose not to teach, can decide not to do any studying or writing for as long as he likes, but he can always re-enter the academic world.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Barred}{\fs24 : Priests of the following gods, forces and philosophies cannot take this kit: Competition, Fertility, Life-Death-Rebirth Cycle, Strength, and War.
\par \tab Priests of the following types are most appropriate for this kit: Arts, Crafts, Culture, Divinity of Mankind, Literature/Poetry, Music/Dance, and Wisdom.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Role:}{\fs24  In the campaign, this priest is motivated by his desire for knowledge. He'll often be tempted by adventures where he's likely to be able to learn something. If an adventuring party is going to a ruin wh
ere a famous library once stood, he'll eagerly join on the faint hope that some scrap of that library still survives. He'll be part of expeditions to visit famous sites or ancient beings who might tell him stories of the past or solve old mysteries. He mi
ght be part of an adventure just so that he can chronicle it and preserve its events in history.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Secondary Skills:}{\fs24  The Scholar Priest must take Scribe as his secondary skill.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Weapon Proficiencies:}{\fs24  Required: None. Recommended: Any appropriate to the priest's actual priest-class. Note: See "Special Benefits," below.
\par \tab Nonweapon Proficiencies: Bonus Proficiency: Reading/Writing. Recommended: (General) Artistic Ability, Etiquette, Heraldry, Languages (Modern), (Priest) Ancient History, Astrology, Languages (Ancient), Local History.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Equipment: }{\fs24 
The scholar-priest must always have writing material, quill and ink with him. If ever he loses them, he must regain or replace them as soon as possible, and in the meantime will be recording his experiences in any fashion 
he can find. Other than that, this kit makes no demands on the way he spends his money.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Special Benefits:}{\fs24  The Scholar Priest can "spend" any of his Weapon Proficiency slots on Nonweapon Proficiencies instead. He doesn't have to; he can adhere to the norma
l pattern of proficiency choice that is appropriate to his priest-class. But if he wishes he may turn Weapon Proficiency slots into Nonweapon slots and thereby become a very skilled character. Also, the Scholar receives a +3 reaction bonus from other scho
l
ars, admirers of scholastic concerns, writers, journalists, and people who imagine that they are scholars. Because of this, when the party thinks it is in a situation when no one is willing to help, it may turn out that the mousy clerk, antagonistic king 
or homely witch they met is an admirer of or even correspondent with the Scholar Priest and will help them.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Special Hindrances:}{\fs24  Many scholars are egotistical, and debates between scholars can become very heated and personal. Whenever the DM rolls a reactio
n check from another scholar, he should first roll 1d6. On a 1, the player-character scholar gets a }{\i\fs24 -6}{\fs24 
 reaction adjustment instead of a +3, because at some time in the past (or even the present) he argued or disagreed with this scholar's pet opinion and offended him completely.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Wealth Options:}{\fs24  The Scholar Priest gets the standard 3d6x10 gp starting gold.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Races:}{\fs24  No special limitations.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Recording Kits on the Character Sheet}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab To record your priest kit on your character record sheet, do the following: 
\par \tab (1) When you write down the character's priest-class, also add the name of his priest kit there. If the character were a priest of the Norse god of thunder and also a peasant priest, you'd write "Priest of Thor/Peasant Priest."
\par \tab (2) Where you write down the character's nonweapon proficiencies, add the ones you got free from the priest kit, and put an asterisk beside them to indicate that they are free proficiencies provided by the kit. 
\par \tab (3) Wherever you have space for notes, mark down the character's special benefits and hindrances, and any other facts you want to remember.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Multi-Class and Dual-Class Characters}{\fs24  
\par \tab 
\par \tab Any multi-class priest can take one of the Priest Kits above. However, he can only take one kit, total. If he has several character classes, he can't take a separate kit for each class.
\par \tab The same is true of dual-class characters. If a character begins play as a priest and takes one of the kits above, and then later changes to another class, he does not have to abandon the kit. However, he st
ill may only have one kit. Also, if he chooses to abandon the kit when he changes class, he may not then take on a kit from the new class. The character may only have had one kit, ever, as long as he is played.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Abandoning Kits}{\fs24  
\par \tab 
\par \tab A character created with
 a Priest Kit might, later in his adventuring career, decide that he has to abandon it. For instance, a Pacifist Priest might be crushed when his inaction resulted in the death of a friend, and might decide to abandon his pacifistic stance.
\par \tab 
The player must tell the DM that he wishes his character to abandon the kit. If this choice is the result of some traumatic event, as in the example above, the character may simply wish to declare his intent. If the choice is a gradual one, the DM may wan
t to work it into the storyline.
\par \tab The priest abandoning his kit will have to role-play out his decision and its consequences. He'll announce his decision . . .  and he must suffer the reactions of his allies (and the other members of his order!), whether good or ill.
\par \tab He will give up all the kit's bonuses and hindrances. The character does not give up any bonus proficiencies, but they are no longer "bonuses." The character must "pay" for them by spending the next proficiency slots he receives on them.
\par \tab Once he's abandoned a Priest Kit, the character may not take another Priest Kit to replace it. At this point, he's a normal priest of his specific mythos for the rest of his playing life.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Modifying and Creating Kits}{\fs24  
\par 
\par \tab The DM should alter the kits above in order to fit them better into his campaign world.
\par \tab For instance, if there are no Savage races to which the PCs could belong, the DM should disallow the Savage Priest kit.
\par \tab If you'd like to create all-new Priest Kits, refer to the kit creation rules in The Complete Fighter's Handbook. 
\par \tab  
\par }{\b\fs32\cf2 Role-Playing}{\fs24 
\par 
\par \tab There's more to role-playing priests than bashing miscreants, casting spells, waving holy symbols and making earnest pronouncements. In this chapter, we're going to talk about the differences between priests,
 even priests of the same orders, and about how they relate to the campaign world and their deities.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Priest Personalities}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab No two priests are alike in their goals, desires, quirks, and prejudices. It doesn't matter if they belong to the same priest-
class, have the same Priest Kit, are at the same experience level and have rolled the same hit points . . .  they're going to be different people.
\par \tab Below are descriptions of several common type of priest characters. All of these personalities are drawn fro
m priest character stereotypes common to the movies and fiction. Novice role-players should read through these descriptions and, if they wish, adopt one of these personality types for their priest characters or at least let these descriptions inspire them
 to work out the details of their characters' personalities. Experienced role-players, to whom the creation of personalities is second nature, should skip on to "Priest Adventures."  
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 The Crusader}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab 
The Crusader is a priest with a mission. What that mission is, is up to the player and the DM; he may wish to convert the heathens, to restore a temple to its original glory, to clean up a corrupt priesthood, to crush the enemies of his faith, to destroy 
a powerful clan, or to gain special rights or privileges for (or merely a lifting of bad or prejudicial laws from) his people.
\par \tab This is not such a bad thing when the Crusader's goals correspond to the goals of the adventuring party. That's easy to sustain f
or a multi-episode adventure. But when the other player-character heroes' attention turns to some other matter or enemy, the Crusader is less willing to go along. He may continue on with them for a time, but his attention always turns back to his personal
 crusade.
\par \tab The Crusader is best suited to lawful alignments (lawful good, lawful neutral, lawful evil). He tends to be humorless, but certainly doesn't have to be stupid.
\par \tab In combat situations, the Crusader is a straightforward fighter, all according to the
 limitations of his priestly class. But if the enemy is related to his Crusade, he'll become the fiercest and most energetic of fighters, sometimes taking dangerous risks and going all-out to rid himself of this most personal enemies.
\par \tab In role-playing situ
ations, he doesn't have to be a boring idiot who talks about nothing but his quest. He can have other goals and interests, too. But the further away he is from his personal crusade, and the less he is able to promote his goals, the more of his attention t
hey will take up in his mind.
\par \tab 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 The Earnest Novice}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab This priest is a young fellow who has newly achieved his priestly rank. (Yes, all first-level priests are appropriate for this personality . . . but not all of them }{\i\fs24 have}{\fs24 
 to take it. Other first-level priests can be a little more sophisticated or world-wise than this fellow.)
\par \tab The Earnest Novice is naive. He's easily tricked by smooth, polished liars. He is pure in his beliefs, especially those related to his priestly orde
r. He serves as an inspiration for others; no matter how battered he is by life, he seems always just to stand back up and keep on going.
\par \tab This character is best suited to the range of good alignments (lawful good, neutral good, chaotic good).
\par \tab In combat s
ituations, this character is prone to be a bit simple. He has very primitive combat tactics, such as "run at the enemy and hit him," or "stand where you are and shoot him;" such things as flanking maneuvers, feints, false retreats, and other military mane
uvers are beyond his comprehension.
\par \tab In role-playing situations, this character expresses cheerful optimism and, usually, a lack of understanding about the way the "real world" (that is, the campaign world) works. It doesn't occur to him to slip a waiter a 
bribe to get better service: That would be monstrously unfair and unprofessional! The ideas that a colleague might be corrupt, that a judge might render a decision based on how he felt that morning, that a beautiful young lady might not be absolutely virt
uous are all alien to him. He'll accept them when his nose is rubbed in them . . .  but they'll never occur to him naturally.
\par \tab Most players who take this personality eventually abandon it; it's nearly impossible to play a character as remaining entirely innocent of the world through adventure after adventure. See "Changing Personality Types" below for more on this.
\par \tab 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 The Hypocrite}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab This priest is a smooth talker and an advocate of all the goals of his priesthood and all the virtuous behaviors there are. B
ut, deep down, he doesn't believe in them. He's fooled his superiors in the priestly order, he's probably fooled his adventuring companions, he's certainly fooled his flock . . .  but he himself knows the truth.
\par \tab This is a pretty villainous personality type; when a hypocrite priest isn't a villain, he's merely weak-willed. Either way, such characters are rare among player-character heroes. And they never get away with it forever.
\par \tab Here are some examples of this character's typical behavior:
\par \tab He generously g
ifts coins to city beggars and earns their praise. But on the side, out of sight, he trafficks in stolen goods, perhaps including objects stolen from temples of his order, and uses the respect accorded to priests to smuggle his stolen goods through city g
ates and inspection lines.
\par \tab When a beautiful young member of the flock comes tearfully to him with problems, he arranges to see her privately to counsel her. Alone with the troubled young lady, he will seduce her, then abandon her, blackmailing her with the
 besmirching of her reputation to keep his own reputation clean. And should she, in her grief, decide to commit suicide, he'll be the most anguished of mourners at her funeral (perhaps he will officiate) . . .  and then begin to work on the young lady's b
etter-looking friends the same way.
\par \tab When sinners come to him after doing evil, they'll always find absolution . . .  for a hefty price in gold pieces. Such sinners are almost always repeat offenders, and so they are also repeat spenders.
\par \tab Obviously, this sort of personality is best-suited to non-player characters. But it is always an option for, and can be a challenge to, player-characters as well.
\par \tab The Hypocrite is limited to lawful neutral, lawful evil, true neutral, and neutral evil character alignments.
\par \tab 
In combat situations, the Hypocrite will tend to behave like the priest he's supposed to be. If he can find reason to get out of the way of combat, he will: For instance, if an ally is injured, the Hypocrite will drop behind the lines to heal or doctor h
im. The Hypocrite is also prone to directing the actions of his teammates in such a way that they take all the risks. If one of them is killed or injured, of course, he will appear to agonize over it.
\par \tab In role-playing situations, the Hypocrite will be the smoothest and most concerned character around. However, his player will need to communicate, in private consultation with the DM or through secret notes, the Hypocrite's true motives and plans.

\par \tab Eventually the other characters will catch on, and ultimately
 they will expose or even kill him. It's up to the player then to decide what the Hypocrite will do (assuming he survives): He could change his name and start over again elsewhere, or pretend to reform and become a little more sophisticated in his tactics
, or he could even reform and change personality types.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 The Motivator}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab This character is like a grown-up version of the Earnest Novice. He knows what the world is all about, but he intends to do his temple's business and see to it that his god's goal
s are met, with no complaints and no back-talk. He's a combination of cheerleader and drill sergeant. He leads by example, and he usually leads. He gets to know the minds of his companions and plays upon their own goals and desires to get his accomplished
. This doesn't make him a villain like the Hypocrite; he probably intends this to be to everyone's benefit. 
\par \tab Like the Crusader, he performs best when he's headed in the direction of his personal goal; unlike the Crusader, he doesn't have just one goal that
 dominates his life, and can add the other player-characters' goals to their own. (But if he does take on someone else's goal, you can be sure that he'll be unceasing and maybe unbearable in trying to motivate that character toward that goal. He won't let
 the other character abandon the goal. He jut never gives up.)
\par \tab This character is suited to any alignment. Obviously, if he's lawful good, his goals will be the goals of his god and his society; if he's chaotic evil, his goals will be his own, and very destructive ones, too.
\par \tab In combat situations, the Motivator charges into the thick of things and tries to whip up his allies into a combat frenzy. He gravitates to the center of the skirmish line, and if he's fit for it will try to take on the biggest and baddest opponents.

\par \tab In role-playing situations, he'll be a vigorous font of advice and helpfulness. He tends to be abrupt of speech and firmly set in his opinions (i.e., stubborn), but he's usually a good friend to have around.
\par \tab  
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 The Philosopher}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab This character tries to fit each of his adventures and encounters into the grand scheme of the meaning of life. He's not a very exciting personality, being more thoughtful and reserved than the dynamic Motivator o
r energetic Earnest Novice. He often adopts a "Let's wait and see what happens" or "Maybe it was meant to be" attitude. He seldom initiates combat or aggression, but this doesn't make him a pacifist; once he gets into combat, he can be as formidable an op
ponent as any priest of his class.
\par \tab The Philosopher is best suited to lawful and neutral alignments (lawful good, lawful neutral, lawful evil, neutral good, true neutral, neutral evil).
\par \tab In combat situations, the Philosopher will often hang back for a round
 or so to gauge the situation and analyze things. In doing so, he may see something the other characters have missed (more enemies creeping out of a secret panel, an exit tunnel that would allow them to escape, or the stealthy motions of an enemy thief cr
eeping around behind one of the heroes). But he won't hesitate long, particularly when it could mean life or death to his friends.
\par \tab In role-playing situations, he tends to be very analytical, choosing his words carefully, thinking all the while.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 The Politician}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab This is an ambitious priest. He wants to have political power within the community, within the temple, or both. This doesn't mean he's bad; he may be acquiring power because he believes he can wield it better than others and make the world a be
tter place. But he goes out of his way to gather favors, advise powerful people (and to do so well!), to acquire treasure so that he can build great temples and influence the masses, etc.
\par \tab The Politician has a weakness, though. Regardless of his motivation
s, he sometimes blinds himself to the truth so that he can continue acquiring power and influence. If two cities or countries are on the verge of war, and that war would benefit him and his power base, he might advocate that war be declared, and blind him
s
elf to the suffering this will cause among the people who have to do the fighting. If a woman comes to him with the classic dilemma where she is being told by her family to marry one man when she loves another, the Politician will first consider the influ
ence he might gain from these respective matches first, and considers the lovers' and families' feelings second. He may not even realize this . . .  but his advice will always be tinged with self-interest.
\par \tab This is also a challenging role to play, especiall
y if the character really is good at heart and is just concealing from himself the harm of his course of action. Eventually, the DM should confront him with the results of his selfishness: Perhaps one of his plans or pieces of advice results in tragedy, a
n
d the accusations of the PCs or NPCs who see through his motives convince him that he's been on the wrong path. When this happens, the Politician might wish to change to another personality type. On the other hand, sometimes the Politician is never caught
 at it, or never admits his culpability to himself, and just continues rising up the ladder of power and influence.
\par \tab The Politician is best suited to lawful and neutral alignments (lawful good, lawful neutral, lawful evil, neutral good, true neutral, neutra
l evil). If he's Good, he'll probably eventually understand the damage he has done and can do. If he's Neutral, he won't go out of his way to harm people, but will not be truly touched by it when harm does occur. If he's Evil, this harm is merely another 
benefit of the job.
\par \tab In combat situations, the Politician is like any other priest of his specific priest-class. However, if there's an important person around to impress, he may fight more vigorously or risk himself to save that person.
\par \tab In role-playing si
tuations, the Politician is continually ferreting out rumors and news, analyzing information, learning the personalities of important people, and looking at all situations and adventures in terms of the power and prestige they can bring him.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 The Proselytizer}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab This priest's primary motivation involves converting worshippers of other gods to worship of his god. Nothing else matters. If someone is not according due to his god, that someone is going to experience a religious conversion attempt. (This doe
sn't mean that the Proselytizer necessarily believes his god to be the only god. In a land where many gods are worshipped, this is an uncommon belief. But if he finds someone who worships several gods but excludes his deity, the Proselytizer goes on the j
ob.)
\par \tab Proselytizers can be of any alignment, but most are dutiful priests of good alignment (lawful good, neutral good, and chaotic good).
\par \tab In combat situations, the Proselytizer acts as any other adventurer. He might be more gullible when it comes to an en
emy who pretends interest in his deity and professes a desire to be converted, but this will only occasionally take place in the campaign. (The enemy would have to know him and his motivations pretty well to make this attempt.)
\par \tab But in role-playing situations, the Proselytizer talks about little other than his god, his temple, and his personal adventures in service to his god and his temple. He can be quite insufferable at times, in fact.
\par \tab Ultimately, his adventures may convince him that there are other thi
ngs to life than the ongoing conversion of non-believers; at this time, his player may choose for the character to take on a new, different personality. But even then, the character is likely to remain a bit more interested in religious conversions than o
ther examples of his new personality are.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 The Sage Counselor}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab 
This priest is primarily interested in acquiring wisdom and passing it on. He likes to help people. And since he's a priest, people often come to him with their troubles; he's always willing to advise them. (Depending on his experience and personal wisdom
, he could be quite good at it, too.) 
\par \tab This personality is best suited to lawful good and neutral good alignments. (A chaotic good priest could also try to be a sage counselor, but his advice is likely to be more dramatic and less well-reasoned than that of the other alignments.)
\par \tab In combat situations, the Sage Counselor is likely to try to persuade the enemy to surrender, to run away, or just to be reasonable. This doesn't mean that he's stupid, though. Confronted with danger, he can hit just as hard and d
efend himself and his friends just as fiercely.
\par \tab In role-playing situations, the Sage Counselor goes out of his way to help people; if he sees a sad face and has some time available to him, he'll gravitate to the stricken person, kindly ask if he can help,
 and end up wrapped again in some other person's troubles. Incidentally, this is a great way to get the character involved on new adventures: The DM need merely run a tearful NPC past the priest, and another adventure is on its way.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Changing Personality Types}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab Sometimes, as mentioned above, it becomes necessary for a player to re-think his character's personality. Perhaps the character has outgrown that personality. (The Earnest Novice must eventually grow up, for instance.) Perhaps dramatic events h
ave forced the character to re-think his goals and attitudes. (This often happens to the Crusader and the Politician.)
\par \tab Since these Personality Types are not part of an official rule or game mechanic, the player can change them as he chooses. He shouldn't 
change his character's personality just because he's bored with it, though: Events in the campaign should be the factors which influence this change. Here are some ways it can come about.
\par \tab The}{\b\fs24  Crusader}{\fs24  might achieve his life-long goal, or lead one party to
o many into death and disaster and realize that all he's doing is hurting people. In this case, he could become embittered and turn into a Hypocrite, playing on his good reputation, or could tone his approach down and become a Motivator, or could achieve 
a measure of wisdom and become a Sage Counselor.
\par \tab The}{\b\fs24  Earnest Novice}{\fs24  could wise up and realize that the world is a more complicated and unfathomable place than he thought. If he becomes disillusioned by this, he could turn into a Hypocrite. If he simply mat
ures a bit, he'd be a Motivator. If he acquires a specific goal, he could become a Crusader, Politician or Proselytizer. And if he simply acquires a bit of wisdom or perspective, he could become a Philosopher or Sage Counselor.
\par \tab The }{\b\fs24 Hypocrite}{\fs24  could change 
his personality if he is confronted by the harm he causes and cares at all about it. (If he doesn't care, he won't change.) If he does change, he's likely to become a Crusader (trying to expose and eliminate other Hypocrites), a Politician (so he can gain
 enough power to weed Hypocrites out of his order), or even a Sage Counselor (who can possibly anticipate the tactics of other charismatic users).  
\par \tab The }{\b\fs24 Motivator}{\fs24  could run out of energy; after too many years of battering himself against the brick wall of 
an uncaring world, he might tire out. In this case, he's likely to become a more sedate Philosopher or Sage Counselor. He could conceivably become embittered and become a Hypocrite.
\par \tab The }{\b\fs24 Philosopher}{\fs24  isn't likely to change. His personality comes with maturi
ty, not before it. If he does change, it will probably be because he's grown tired of being dull and undramatic, and he's likely to become a Motivator, one anxious for adventure, combat and life in general.
\par \tab The }{\b\fs24 Politician}{\fs24  will probably change only if he perceives that he's doing more than good (and if he minds that). In this case, he'll probably shy away from real responsibility in the future and become a Philosopher.
\par \tab The }{\b\fs24 Proselytizer}{\fs24  is likely to realize that he is not serving his god best simply by conv
erting others to that god's worship. He's likely then to become a Crusader, so that he can avidly pursue one of his god's specific goals; a Motivator, so that he can bring energy to other priests of his order; or a Politician, so that he can improve the s
tature of his god's worship through reorganization of the priesthood.
\par \tab The}{\b\fs24  Sage Counselor}{\fs24 , like the Philosopher, isn't likely to change; this is a personality that is acquired with experience.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 All Sense and No Brains}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab And now we're faced with one of the commonest questions about clerics and druids: How do you role-play a character who has a high Wisdom score and a low Intelligence score? How do you play all sense and no brains within an AD&D\'ae game campaign?

\par \tab Intelligence deals more with reasoning power, calculating ability, and memory retention. Wisdom deals with common sense, understanding of human nature, and judgement.
\par \tab So when you're role-playing a character with a low Intelligence and a high Wisdom, try to break down the situations they face into the elements which the character's Intelligence and Wisdom would analyze.
\par \tab  }{\i\fs24 Example: The characters have come to a rickety bridge which spans a gorge. They need to cross the gorge, but the bridge looks dangerous. Should they cross? 
\par \tab  The character's Intel
ligence will evaluate the bridge's chances of holding up while they cross over. The character will look at the state of the wood, ropes, nails, how much and where it sags, where it's rotted through, and so on, and then will try to calculate the answer to 
t
his question: Will the bridge hold up if the characters cross over? If the character thinks it will, then his reply, regardless of the group's current situation and time available, is Yes: They should cross. If the character thinks it won't, then his repl
y will be No: They shouldn't. 
\par \tab  The character's Wisdom will compare the risk to their need and situation. The risk is that the bridge will collapse and kill someone, perhaps a party member dear to everyone. What is their current situation? If the party has
 little time and is being pursued by a superior enemy force, then the risk is necessary, more or less regardless of what the Intelligence thinks of the bridge's chances; the character will say Yes, they must try to cross now. If the party has a good deal 
of time, then the risk is not necessary; regardless of how safe the Intelligence thinks the bridge is, Wisdom says not to risk it. A human life is not worth it. 
\par }{\fs24 \tab This is the kind of decision-making process the character can undertake if he wishes to role-p
lay a high-Wisdom, low-Intelligence character in a campaign . . .  and obviously it can lead to great arguments between them and their high-Intelligence, low-Wisdom counterparts.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Priest Adventures}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab The DM may want to slant some of his campaign's adventures specifically to his priest player-characters. It's not hard to do that; he has only to build the adventure around one or more of the priest's duties or responsibilities.
\par \tab The priest-oriented plot device we use to motivate the priest to action is called a }{\i\fs24 Hook}{\fs24 
. To design an adventure around the priest character, the DM has to provide a hook that will bring the priest into the adventure, and do so in such a way that the adventure doesn't exclude the other player-characters.
\par \tab The hook must address the priest in one of his priestly roles or duties. Below we present a variety of hooks and approaches to this sort of adventure.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Advisor of the Faithful}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab The priest provides guidance to the flock. Followers of the temple come to him for advice, and he's supposed to give it.
\par \tab That advice can't be correct all the time, especially when the faithful come to him with no-win situations. When it goes wrong, the priest will probably feel guilty. When it goes disastrously wrong, and the injured
 party comes to the priest for help, the priest will probably be willing (if not anxious) to clean the situation up.
\par \tab As an example of this hook, let's say a doting father comes to the priest with this story: His son has come to him and asked for money so 
that he can buy weapons and armor. His son has heard of a bandit encampment where there is much treasure to be found. The son is sure that with the right weapons and armor and a little luck he can sneak into the camp when most of the bandits are gone, def
e
at the guards, and make off with the treasure. The father doesn't know where the encampment is; his son won't tell him. The son is a good fighter and knows what he's talking about; on the other hand, he is youthful and a bit overconfident. The father asks
 "Should I give my son the money for this equipment?"
\par \tab If the priest says Yes, the father does so. The son tries the raid but is captured after killing several bandits. The bandits send back his bloody, broken sword from their mystery encampment, with a ran
som demand which the father (and even the PCs) cannot match.
\par \tab If the priest says No, the father follows his advice. The son tries it anyway, and is captured because he was under-equipped; no bandits died. Again, the son is ransomed beyond the father's means.
\par \tab 
If the priest says "Maybe, but my friends and I would like to get in on it," the father will take him to talk to the son. The son will sound agreeable to the proposition, but will sneak off at first opportunity. He doesn't want anyone else horning in o
n his adventure. And because he had to charge off prematurely, he doesn't know enough about the bandit encampment and is caught up in snares set around its perimeter. Here, again, he's captured and ransomed.
\par \tab In either of these three cases, the father come
s back to the priest to say, in effect, "Your lousy advice got my son captured, and I can't ransom him! Please save him!" Which the priest will be inclined to do . . .  and he'll probably want to have his friends, the other PCs, along with him.
\par \tab Incidental
ly, we don't recommend that you face your PCs with no-win situations such as the one above very often. It wouldn't be fair to do this time and time again; the players would (correctly) assume that they could never do anything right unless the DM arbitrari
ly wanted them to.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Agent of the Priesthood}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab When the priest is a low-level character, still near the bottom of the totem pole of the priesthood's hierarchy, his superiors will frequently send him on missions. A mission could be nothing more than "Tak
e this letter over to the priest Aclastion in the next village," or it could be "There's supposed to be some horrible monster menacing our temple in the next village; do you suppose you could round up some of your more violent friends and go over there an
d destroy it for us?"
\par \tab In the latter case, you have a situation where the priest character is the center of attention, and has ample reason and opportunity to invite his non-priest friends in on the action.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Defender of the Faith}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab When the followers o
f one faith make war on the followers of another, the priests get involved in the action. Since these wars tend to take place between entire cultures, the player-character priest will probably be an ally of the other player-characters. In this case, his t
emple superiors are likely to ask him to round up some capable allies and go on dangerous missions into enemy territories, or to hold a crucial mountain pass during a military campaign.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Defender of the Faithful
\par }{\fs24 \tab  
\par \tab You read about Libels in the }{\b\fs24 Designing Faiths}{\fs24  chapter, under "Duties of the Priest," under "Vigilance." (If you didn't, you should now.)
\par \tab When the faithful are threatened by such a libel, the priest must work against it; if he doesn't, or if he fails, his people will suffer more preju
dice and be in more danger from people who believe the libel. (There will be enough who still believe the libel if it is proved false; if the characters }{\i\fs24 can't }{\fs24 prove it false, there will be many more believers still.)
\par \tab   In order to bring the other player-c
haracters in on such a situation, try this technique: One fine day, the priest finds another priest (of the same temple) dead in his chambers. The dead man has been murdered, torn limb from limb. His chambers were barred shut from the inside; a thief coul
d not have picked the bars. In the priest's hand is part of a page from his journal, and the rest of the journal is missing. The scrap of paper, written in his hand, is part of a longer chronicle: "in mortal danger. When the \{
insert the name of an enemy temple\}
 summon the thing, it will kill him and we will be blamed. I know they work from the Citadel of Arbright, but could find out no more; I think perhaps they heard me as I listened to their talk. It is time for me to tell -- " There the passage ends, obvi
ously when the priest was interrupted by his murderer.  
\par \tab This puts the priest-character and his temple in a delicate situation. Obviously, the enemy temple will summon up some sort of monster to kill some person, probably an important person, and the prie
st's temple will get the blame. Obviously, the summoned thing, whatever sort of monster it is, can penetrate locked chambers without violating the locks and bars.
\par \tab The priest and his temple have to know more. But the authorities will not allow them to sear
ch the Citadel of Arbright, home of a powerful local family, on this flimsy and perhaps fabricated evidence. Therefore, the priest must sneak in, find out what is to be found out, and escape. He'll need the help of his friends . . . 
\par \tab And what they do find
 out, of course, is that the Clan Arbright is aiding the enemy temple. They together have found a way to summon an outer-planar creature into sealed chambers, and they plan to do this some night when the High Priest of the player-character's temple is clo
seted with the king. The being will kill the king and leave the high priest to take the blame, resulting in damage, perhaps permanent damage, to the faith . . .  unless the priest-PC and his friends can thwart the plan.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Martyr for a Cause}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab The priest
's god or the rules of the priestly order might force the priest to undertake some actions that the local authorities just don't understand or approve of. (See below, under "Society's Punishments," for more on this.) If the priesthood is not protected aga
inst prosecution by the secular (non-priestly) authorities, then the priest might find himself on trial for any illegal action performed in the god's name.
\par \tab   Gods usually don't appear in court as defense witnesses. Therefore, the priest-PC must defend hims
elf through legal means without the benefit of divine testimony. If he's convicted, he might have to escape jail to avoid execution; he might even choose to accept execution in order to dramatize the injustice of his plight. Or, the court might sentence h
i
m to some suicidal mission to atone for the crime he committed. He isn't required by the court to go on the mission alone, but no NPC adventurers want to march with him into certain doom. Thus the priest character is again brought into an adventure becaus
e of his faith, and his friends the other PCs, if they truly are his friends, will accompany him on this quest.  
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Servant of the God}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab   The god himself will sometimes send the PC on missions. Often, he will appear to the PC when he is alone, or will 
appear to him in dreams, and make his wish known: "You will travel to the wild lands of the Sylvan Curtain and there find the artifact known as the Eagle-Spear. Find it; take it from our enemies, who hold it; bring it back and install it in your temple  .
 . . "   
\par \tab When he investigates the Sylvan Curtain and the Eagle-Spear, the priest will find that it's certain death to go there alone. He needs adventurers of all descriptions and abilities to help him if he's to pull off this adventure successfully . . . 

\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Rites and Role-Playing}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab In a lot of campaigns, it's easy to ignore one of the priest's foremost functions: He's also the officiator at lots of rites, rituals, celebrations and ceremonies.
\par \tab Every faith will have its own rituals and other special events; careful, judicious use of these will add a lot of detail and flavor to a campaign.
\par \tab The DM }{\i\fs24 shouldn't}{\fs24  sit down and work up a lot of rituals for each priesthood in his campaign, and then keep them juggling around in his mind until they emerge, one by one, during adventures. But what he }{\i\fs24 should }{\fs24 
do is bring individual ceremonies and priestly events into his campaign as adventure and story hooks.
\par \tab For example:
\par \tab "Jeriash, your party arrives in the city on October 30th. Now, you could head on from there the ne
xt day, but November 1st is Vine Day, which commemorates your goddess stopping her work for the year, winter setting in, wine-making ceremonies, and so forth; it sort of behooves you to volunteer your help at the local temple for that event . . . "
\par \tab The Vi
ne Day celebration, a Mardi Gras-like costumed parade featuring wine-drinking excesses, is a good opportunity to inject some color into the current storyline, but that isn't all it has to be. The DM could wrap an entire story around it; for example, imagi
ne trying to capture a group of ghouls as they roam these streets strewn with drunken, costumed celebrants.
\par \tab Though the DM shouldn't work up all a priesthood's usual ceremonies in advance, whenever he does create one, he should make note of it. If he doesn'
t, and the right time of year rolls around again, the players will inevitably remember it and wonder why Vine Day isn't being celebrated this year . . . 
\par \tab Following are descriptions of a number of different types of rituals. Each of these can be adapted to
 the characteristics of different faiths and different gods. Not all cultures and not all gods will feature each of these types of rituals; the DM should decide which apply to which gods and to which societies.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Atonement}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab When the flock sins, or acts against the wishes of the god, the faith usually has a way for the sinner to reenter the god's good graces. This is an act of atonement. Usually, the bigger the sin, the more extravagant the act of atonement must be.

\par \tab The first
 part of this process is usually the confession , a formal meeting of sinner and priest where the sinner confesses his deed. This puts the priest in the position of having to evaluate that sin and then charge the sinner with a course of action which will 
remove the stain of sin.
\par \tab Remember that each different god will have different ideas of what constitutes sin. To the god of Love, for instance, the greatest sin is denial of love (particularly, growing old without having loved) or interfering in love (messi
ng up someone else's romance).
\par \tab Too, you must remember that in a pantheistic society (one which worships many gods), it is not usually a sin to do one god's will at the expense of another. If one culture worships both a god of Peace and a god of War, fomenting a war is}{\i\fs24 
 not}{\fs24  a sin directed at the God of Peace; it's a boon to the God of War.
\par \tab To just about any god, an insult to the god (including verbal insults or desecration of a temple) is considered a sin.
\par \tab Typical ceremonies of atonement include fasts and 
meditations where the sinner asks forgiveness of the god. More extensive sins require some sort of sacrifice (such as donation of a cherished object to the god's temple) or an act of expiation (the sinner doing his best to straighten out the bad situation
 he caused).
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Calendar Ceremonies}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab Lots of gods have ceremonies based around the calendar, especially agricultural gods. Communities may have celebrations for:
\par \tab The day that marks the start of spring;
\par \tab The day when planting begins;
\par \tab The day when harvesting starts;
\par \tab The beginning of the grape-stomping season;
\par \tab The official start of winter;
\par \tab The day that the first trade-ship of the year is launched;
\par \tab The day that some heroic figure, a worshipper of the god, is commemorated;
\par \tab The day of thanks for the god's bounty;
\par \tab The day commemorating some ancient tragedy;
\par \tab The day of the dead (just before or after the night that the ghosts walk the streets);
\par \tab The day commemorating some great battle in which the god participated;
\par \tab ?And so on.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Communion}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab This is a ceremony where the participants try to commune with the god, to invoke a little of his spirit, to briefly become more like the god.
\par \tab Here, too, each god will have a very different ceremony. Communion with the god of Competition will take the form
 of athletic games. Communion with the god of Prosperity will be a great, enormous feast. Communion with the god of Kingship will be a private little coronation where each household leader is acknowledged as the head of the household. Communion with the g
od of Peace will be a quiet meditation. Communion with the god of Love or Fertility is left as an exercise for your imagination.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Confirmation of Adulthood}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab The DM needs to decide when youths are considered to reach adulthood in the culture, and then it's possible to have Confirmations of Adulthood.
\par \tab In a culture, this will be handled one of two ways.
\par \tab Each youth could have a private ceremony on his birthday. Alternatively, all youths born in the same year could be confirmed on one specific day of the calendar.
\par \tab Either way, in the ceremony, the priest will acknowledge the youth as an adult, and this will be marked by allowing the youth some activity which only adults can perform in the culture (for example, carrying weapons in public, wearing some garme
nt reserved for adults, receiving a sword, etc.).
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Confirmation of Birth}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab   With this ceremony, the priest visits the newborn child and, in a simple ceremony, asks the god's blessings upon the child. This is always done in the presence of witnesses, 
because it's important in the culture for others to witness that the child has been born and that specific people (the parents) acknowledge the child as theirs. This becomes important regarding questions of inheritance or the succession of the titles of l
eadership.  
\par \tab  
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Fast}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab This is a quiet sort of ceremony; the participants do not eat, usually for the period of a day, as a sacrifice to the god or a commemoration of some historical time of want.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Feast
\par }{\fs24 \tab  
\par \tab The feast can be as small or great a feast a
s the DM cares to allow, and can celebrate just about anything within the faith. Feasts should be one of the most common sorts of celebrations within the faith, and a great feast is a convenient place to introduce all sorts of adventure elements (challeng
es from enemies, assassination attempts, mysterious clues left in the soup, etc.).
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Funeral}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab Interment of the dead is also a common ceremony. Note that funerals don't have to be solemn affairs; all this depends on what the culture thinks happens to th
e departed spirit and how the culture feels about it. The funeral could be a time of mourning, a cheerful celebration of the departed person's life, a drinking-binge so that the mourners can forget their grief, and so on.
\par \tab In any case, the ceremony can have several parts. 
\par \tab There is the Wake, which takes place before the funeral, where participants sit overnight with the body, exchange stories of the dead person's deeds, and (in some settings) protect the body from violation at the hands of evil spirits, wh
o might try to inhabit and reanimate it, or to steal the not-yet-departed soul.
\par \tab There is the Farewell, where the participants speak to the corpse of the departed and wish him well on his voyage; often, they present him with small gifts and tokens of their friendship.
\par \tab There is the Interment, where the body is laid to rest, usually with the presents and a variety of the person's belongings. In some cultures of a type we consider cruel, the person's slaves and perhaps even his wife will also be laid to rest
, even if they aren't dead yet. (Alternatively, the body may be burned, again depending on the culture's views.)
\par \tab   There is the Commemoration, where the mourners exchange stories of the dead person; this could be a very solemn or a very merry event. In any case, it's likely to accompany a feast for the weary, hungry mourners and participants.  
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Libation
\par }{\fs24 \tab  
\par \tab Libation is the dedication of a little of one's drink to the gods. Every time a glass is refilled, the character pours a little to his god, either onto the ground or into a basin dedicated to the god.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Meditation}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab This consists of sitting, in private or with other participants, and trying to achieve a peaceful state of exalted awareness.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Mysteries}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab These are involved ceremonies which usu
ally celebrate gods of nature or rebirth. Celebrated annually or semi-annually, they tend to have several elements and can go on for a full day or more, not counting the rituals which precede the actual celebration of the mysteries. Usually, the pattern i
s something like this:
\par \tab In the days before the actual celebration, the participants go through }{\i\fs24 purification}{\fs24 . These rituals of purification involve fasting, ritual baths, and abstinence from physical pleasures.
\par \tab On the day of the celebration, the participants dress in clothing appropriate to the ceremony, usually in featureless clothing of white (or a color preferred by the god), usually barefoot. They assemble at the temple of the god, and perform the }{
\i\fs24 oath-taking}{\fs24 
. A high priest administers the oath, where every participant swears that he will keep what he has seen a secret, and never discuss it with one who is not also an initiate into the mysteries. The participant swears in the god's name, and could suffer the 
god's punishment if he breaks his oath.
\par \tab Next, there is the }{\i\fs24 procession.}{\fs24  All the priests and participants proceed in a parade to a site that is holy to the god. This is often a cavern or a very secluded glade, because there it is possible to keep the celebra
tion hidden from the eyes of non-initiates. The procession is led by ranking priests, followed by lesser priests in charge of sacrifices, followed by musicians who play during the procession. Then come priestesses, who carry small caskets (or draw carts b
e
aring those caskets); the caskets contain artifacts sacred to the god. (These artifacts aren't necessarily, or even usually, powerful magical items desired by greedy adventurers. They're more ordinary items: The rock sacred to the god, the fossilized ston
e
 showing the god's footprint, the bone from the feast in which the god participated, the statue the god himself blessed, the cast-off weapon used by the god in some famous event, and so on.) Then, there are more functionary priests: Priests in charge of t
h
e upcoming feast, priests who lead sacrificial animals (if sacrifice is a part of this culture's worship), and priests who act as sergeants-at-arms (they carry non-lethal weapons such as staffs and use them to keep the disorderly orderly). Finally, the fa
ithful (non-priest) followers come.
\par \tab Once the procession reaches the sacred site, there may be a }{\i\fs24 sacred meal}{\fs24 . Sacrificial animals will be sacrificed and cooked, and then the feast eaten. The character of the meal depends on the character of the god: It coul
d be stern and somber for a severe god, wild and orgiastic for a more free-spirited god. The sacred meal ends after nightfall.
\par \tab Then, the three most important elements of the mysteries begin. They all take place at night.
\par \tab First is the}{\i\fs24  recitation}{\fs24  , a serie
s of songs or chants concerning the god, his deeds, his promises to the faithful, his demands on the faithful. The recitation sets the mood for the rest of the ceremonies; the listening followers are supposed to be reverential, at least, and the priests w
ith the staves are still around to keep order and quell (or get rid of) troublemakers. Troublemakers tend to be rare.
\par \tab Second, there is the }{\i\fs24 display}{\fs24 . The sacred objects carried in those caskets are displayed for the faithful. Since they actually are magical objects sacred to the god, they tend to inspire the faithful with the essence of the god.

\par \tab Third, there is the }{\i\fs24 performance. Priests}{\fs24  trained as actors perform a play which commemorates the most famous of the god's stories, especially the one which most clos
ely deals with the god's demands on and relations with his worshippers. Regardless of the quality of this play, it is performed at the end of a lengthy process of worship where the followers are exposed to many powerful forces of the faith, and the onlook
ers are all elevated to a state of rapture during the performance.
\par \tab At the end, there is the }{\i\fs24 rebirth}{\fs24 . Once the performance has ceased, the lights are doused and the faithful are led in pitch darkness from the area where the play was performed. Once they arr
ive at the point of departure, where the procession home will begin, the torches or lamps are again lit, and among the faithful this journey in darkness is much like being born again.
\par \tab Mysteries are an experience for the spirit, not the mind; this is not a
n educational event, but one which is intended to bring the followers closer to the nature of their god. Even in a culture which worships many gods, only a very few will have mysteries as part of their worship.
\par \tab For the DM, the mysteries are an opportunity
 to introduce dramatic events into the story. During the mysteries, it is appropriate for the god to appear to one of his PC followers and charge that character with an important mission, for instance. Or it could be that during the celebration of the mys
teries, one character will receive some sudden insight (a gift from the god) into some event which has been puzzling or confounding the player-characters for some time.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Naming
\par }{\fs24 \tab  
\par \tab 
This ceremony is often a part of the Confirmation of Birth event: The child is given his name before witnesses. In some cultures, though, the child might be given a use-name when he is born, and won't be given his true name (or will choose his true name) 
years later, when he is old enough to understand its significance. It may be that in this culture the character's true name is supposed to be kept a secret, and the child tells it only to one priest, so that the god might know it.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Prayer}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab Prayer is one of the most common of rituals; it involves asking the blessing of the god, often through the recital of an ancient or famous prayer or part of a holy text.
\par \tab Note that not all cultures demand that prayer be performed from a kneeling position or a pose of obsequience. Vigorous warrior cultures might perform their prayers standing erect and facing the skies, for example.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Purification}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab When a person comes in contact with some contamination (a taboo substance), he must be purified. In some cultures, wh
enever a person has killed another honorably, though he is not considered to have sinned, he must be purified of the killing. This ceremony involves a ritual bathing or washing of the hands (or other contaminated part) under the supervision of a priest, w
ho invokes the god's blessing during the washing.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Sacrifice}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab In some cultures, animals are sacrificed to the glory of the god. One god may demand that the whole animal be destroyed; another will demand that the animal be killed for it and some part o
f it destroyed for him, but that the rest of the beast can be used as the worshippers see fit.
\par \tab Obviously, human sacrifice is something demanded only by the most evil or unsympathetic of gods.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Priests and Punishment}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab Priests are servants of their go
ds, and therefore can't just do anything they want whenever they want. The DM must keep an eye on the activities of priest characters (including clerics and druids), and if the priest violates some tenet or commandment of his god, the DM should see to it 
that the god punishes the priest.
\par \tab It's easy to be unfair when doing this, though, so the DM also has to keep an eye on }{\i\fs24 himself.}{\fs24  It's all too easy to say, "You should have }{\i\fs24 known }{\fs24 
that your god doesn't want you to wear red; I've said repeatedly that his favor
ite color is blue!" That's not justification for a punishment of the priest, unless the DM has explicitly stated that the god's priests must always wear blue or face divine consequences.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Minor Offenses}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab Minor offenses which the god punishes include such things as:
\par \tab Making a joke about the god (and even then, it must offend the god; some gods have a sense of humor);
\par \tab Failing to perform all required priestly duties in a day (for example, "not having the time" to listen to the problems of one of the faithful and offer guidance); and
\par \tab Becoming annoyed with the god's demands.
\par \tab The god punishes such minor offenses by withholding some of the priest's spells on the following day.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Inappropriate Weapon and Armor Use}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab If a priest violates his order's restrictions on weapon and armor use, the god will punish him for it. There are two different types of violation of this restriction, and a different punishment for each.
\par \tab If the priest deliberately violates the restriction
 because he wants to (for instance, if he puts on a set of metal armor when he isn't supposed to), this is a willful disobedience and makes the god very angry. He immediately does 2-12 (2d6) points of damage to the priest and takes away all the spells he 
granted to the priest today, and doesn't let the priest have any more for 1-6 (1d6) days. Even then, the priest must undergo rituals of purification and undertake an act of atonement if he's to have spells again.
\par \tab If the priest violates the restriction for 
the best of reasons (for instance, if a gargoyle is strangling his friend, and he must use a forbidden weapon in order to be able to harm the creature), the god does 1-3 (1d3) points of damage to the priest (}{\i\fs24 after the fight is done}{\fs24 
) and, if the priest does not undertake a ritual of purification at his earliest opportunity, will take away the priest's spells on the next day.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Betrayal of Goals}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab If the priest deliberately violates the goals of the god, then he's in real trouble. For instance, if a priest o
f the god of war advocates peace when war is in the offing, or if a priest of the god of love tells young lovers to wise up and forget about romance, then the god will definitely be offended.
\par \tab   The first time this happens, the god will give the priest an 
unmistakable warning. This could be a heart attack, costing 50% of the priest's current hit points. It could be a portentous destruction of a statue of the god while the priest is present. It could be an earthquake or other warning. The warning doesn't ha
ve to be }{\i\fs24 immediately }{\fs24 after the betrayal, but will be soon after.  
\par \tab The second time this happens, the god will appear to the priest. It doesn't have to be in person, right then; it might be in a dream, the night following the betrayal. The god will sternly 
ask the character his motives and order him to return to proper worship.
\par \tab The third time this happens, the god will immediately reduce the character to 1 hit point and change his character class. The priest will become an ordinary fighter at an experience 
level two lower than the priest's level (minimum first level); his normal hit point total and possessions will be unaffected. Until the character undergoes a severe ritual of atonement, the god will despise the character and plague him with little ills, d
iseases, and enemies. Once the character atones for the deed, the god forgives him . . .  but the character will still be a fighter.
\par \tab Sometimes, a god might deliberately confront the character with a test of the character's faith. For example: Part of the g
od's worship demands that anyone who tramples his sacred flowers be blinded. Then, the god befuddles the priest's wife or daughter, and that character stumbles across the sacred flowers where only the priest can see it. If he conceals the sin, he's punish
ed. If, regretfully, he prepares to carry out the punishment, the god will be pleased. The god might interrupt the punishment, or wait until it has been carried out and then restore sight to the priest's loved one.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Divine Retributions}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab It could be th
at the priest will betray more than the god's usual dictates. The priest might turn on the god, betraying him utterly. This can happen when another deity, an enemy god, persuades the priest to serve him instead, and persuades the priest to steal some impo
rtant artifact from the god or reveal some critical information about the god.
\par \tab When this happens, the god will punish the priest (assuming he survives the betrayal, which most gods will).
\par \tab The minimum punishment the priest can expect is the character class change described above.
\par \tab A medium punishment the god will bestow is instant death.
\par \tab A greater punishment from the god involves the ruin of the character. The god can kill or merely take away the character's family and loved ones, curse him with affliction
s such as blindness and lameness, see to it that all his enemies find out about his weaknesses, give extra power and weapons to his enemies, force the priest's loved ones to betray }{\i\fs24 him}{\fs24 
, and so on. This doesn't happen all at once, but every episode for the 
rest of the character's life introduces some new, horrible calamity until the character is mercifully killed or kills himself. In any case, the character is no longer a viable one to play and the player should dispose of him as quickly as possible.
\par \tab At the ultimate level, the god performs the greater punishment above, and then tortures the character's spirit forever in the afterlife.
\par \tab Note that this punishment isn't just for priests. If a non-priest betrays the god in the same fashion, the god will visit the same sort of punishment on the character.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Society's Punishments
\par }{\fs24 \tab  
\par \tab Unless the priesthood is the State Religion, priests are not immune to the law for their deeds.
\par \tab 
If, for example, the priest of the god of Justice and Revenge hears about some great injustice, wanders over to the offender's house and kills the offender, then he's guilty of murder. There's no question. He'll be arrested, tried, and (the efforts of his
 priesthood notwithstanding) probably convicted; the only thing that could save him would be a declaration from the god, which is usually not forthcoming.
\par \tab Therefore, when priests decide to do something which is illegal in the culture, they should do so cir
cumspectly. If they wish to accomplish the desires of their god when those wishes are illegal, they'll have to do so in a fashion which protects them.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 When Priests Renounce Their Faith}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab It's possible for a priest to renounce his faith # to declare that he is no longer a priest of a particular god. When that happens, he has one of two choices.
\par \tab He can stop belonging to the priest-class and start over as a rogue, wizard, or priest of another god, according to the rules for dual-class characters. Naturally, he loses all his granted powers.
\par \tab If his priesthood had Good Combat Abilities, he can lose one experience level and become a fighter; if Medium Combat Abilities, he can lose two levels and become a fighter; if Poor Combat Abilities, he can start over 
as a fighter according to the rules for dual-class characters. He'll never again be a priest.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 When Gods Bestow Spells}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab Another effect of the fact that priests are servants of their gods is this: The god doesn't have to give his priest the spells the priest wants.
\par \tab In most situations, when the priest prays for his spells, he gets the ones he desires. But if the god and DM wish, he could get different spells on some occasions.
\par \tab There are two usual causes for this to happen:
\par \tab If the god is displeased wi
th the priest for some minor infraction, he might give the priest spells which dictate the priests' actions for the day. A fighting-priest might emerge from his meditation with only healing spells on hand, for instance, a clear sign that the god wants him
 to act in a supporting role today.
\par \tab Or, if the god knows of a specific opponent that the priest will be fighting today, he might give the priest spells appropriate to defeating that enemy.
\par \tab In neither case will the god send a telegram explaining why he's done what he's done. The priest has to accept what the god hands him that day, and has to do so without knowing why.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Priestly Followers}{\fs24  
\par \tab  
\par \tab It's good to remember that the priest's followers, the ones who come to him around 8th level, are not mere spear
-carriers or meat for the monsters. They haven't shown up so that they can be thrown to the jaws of dragons in order to give the priest more time to get away. They've shown up to serve the god and the priest.
\par \tab That's why, in the }{\b\fs24 Designing Faiths}{\fs24  chapter, we talked about giving them names and personalities, and likewise talked about the priest getting fewer and fewer replacements if he wastes the followers he has.
\par \tab Once again, this is a sign that the priest cannot act with utter impunity. He is dependent on 
the good will of his god, and his god will not look kindly on a priest who brings about the deaths of other followers of the god. The god who says, "Yes, my son, kill off my other followers so that you can have more gold" is a foolish god indeed.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Toning Down the Cleric}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab The cleric class is a very powerful one. He has access to sixteen Spheres of Influence (more than }{\i\fs24 any }{\fs24 
other priest-class), good armor, and fair weapons. It's been a sign of the cleric's advantages that he is the preferred character class of many, many campaigns.
\par \tab If this ultra-efficient character is too powerful in your own campaign, you might prefer to alter him. If you want to do this, tell all the cleric players well ahead of time and give them the option to convert their clerics to
 priests of specific mythoi provided in the }{\b\fs24 Sample Priesthoods}{\fs24  chapter.
\par \tab Then, establish the following rules about the Cleric class:
\par \tab (1) Keep his weapon and armor limitations exactly as they are.
\par \tab 
(2) Establish that the Cleric has Major Access to only three spheres (one must be All; the other two are player's choice) and Minor Access to two spheres (player's choice). The player must choose his four sphere options when the Cleric is first created (o
r converted); it may not be changed afterwards. Each Cleric may choose a different set of spheres.
\par \tab Naturally, you should only do this if you personally feel that the cleric class is too powerful in your campaign. If you don't, don't change him.
\par \tab  
\par }{\b\fs32\cf2 Equipment and Combat}{\fs32 
\par }{\fs24 
\par \tab In this chapter, we'll talk about some of the gear that the priest carries and uses in the performance of his duties, and also about new weapons and combat styles used by some priests.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs28\cf2 Priestly Items
\par }{\fs24 \tab  
\par \tab The most common and important tools of the priest (as far as his culture is concerned, anyway) aren't his weapons and armor. They are the actual symbols of his priesthood.
\par \tab Not all of these symbols are useful in combat situations, but they're appropriate for role-playing the priest. Let's discuss them briefly.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 The Canon}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab Many faiths have a }{\i\fs24 canon }{\fs24 , or holy book. This work was written at some time in the distant past, either by the god or by a believer obeying the word of the god. This book usually describes important events of the pa
st in which the god participated, explains the requirements the god makes on his followers, and explains the god's philosophy, goals, and concerns.
\par \tab If the faith has a canon, then the priest will wish to have one. Books are expensive commodities: Assuming that it's a mere 200 sheets (400 pages) in length, according to the costs in the }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook}{\fs24 
, you're talking about 400 gp in paper alone (2 gp per sheet); binding will cost another 50 gp, for a total of 450. Sometime between 3rd and 5th level, the pr
iest should have saved or accumulated enough money to commission a copy of the canon; perhaps, if he is lucky, someone will gift him with one, or he will inherit one. Regardless, a priest who reaches 6th level without having acquired a copy of the canon w
ill be viewed with some suspicion by commoners and his fellow priests, who will question his devotion.
\par \tab The priest should carry the cannon wherever he travels, and if it is stolen should make every effort to recover it. The canon is not a magical work, and does not act as a Holy Symbol when used to confront vampires or similar monsters.
\par \tab Not all faiths do have an individual, written canon. Some faiths share a common canon. Some transmit their canon orally; it is not written down anywhere. Some have none at all.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Holy Symbol}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab Most faiths have a holy symbol, some sign which serves as a representation for the god and his faith. This symbol is usually duplicated in wood, glass, or precious metals and carried by priests of the god. Ordinary followers of the 
god also can carry the holy symbol.
\par \tab Every priest player should know what his holy symbol looks like. The DM can either decide, or let the player of the priest design it. (If he does allow the player to do so, the design of the symbol is still subject to the DM's approval.)
\par \tab It's easy to create symbols for most deities, and there are suggestions for symbols for all the gods represented in the }{\b\fs24 Sample Priesthoods}{\fs24  chapter.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Holy Water}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab Holy water, that bane of vampires and many other monsters, is created in the following way:
\par \tab In a temple of the god, three priests of second level or higher stand over an empty water-basin and perform a ritual of prayer. They pray for the god's blessing an
d protection for an entire hour. At the end of that time, they each cast a spell, and do so simultaneously: One casts}{\i\fs24  create water}{\fs24  , the second casts }{\i\fs24 protection from evil}{\fs24 , and the third casts }{\i\fs24 
purify food & drink}{\fs24 . Half a gallon of holy water is created. 
\par \tab (The }{\i\fs24 create water}{\fs24  spell can create up to four gallons of water, but the }{\i\fs24 protection from evil}{\fs24  and }{\i\fs24 purify food & drink}{\fs24 
 used this way can only create half a gallon of holy water. Therefore, for every two extra priests, one to cast each of those two spells, an extra half-gallon can be created. Nine priests together can create four gallons.)
\par \tab The tremendous expenditure of magic and the time involved are the reasons why a single dose of holy water costs 25 gp to the adventurer. Obviously, any three priests can cre
ate holy water "for free" so long as they are second level or higher and are priests of the same god.
\par \tab Holy symbols are enchanted in the same way. Each enchantment takes an hour, requires three priests (substituting}{\i\fs24  sanctuary}{\fs24  for }{\i\fs24 create water}{\fs24 
), and requires a material component: Some object carved with the god's symbol.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Priestly Vestments}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab As mentioned in the }{\b\fs24 Designing Faiths}{\fs24  chapter, each priesthood has its own distinctive costume, and priests normally wear these priestly vestments whe
never they perform their official duties. Some must wear them whenever they appear in public. 
\par \tab It adds color to a campaign when the players know what these vestments look like. If the DM doesn't wish to design the priestly vestments for all the priest player-characters, he should allow the players to do so (subject to his final approval).

\par }{\fs24 \tab  
\par \tab The }{\b\fs24 Bill}{\fs24  is a short hook on a short cross-handle, and is a weapon derived from the sort of hook used to spear and haul in fish or to carry sides of meat around.
\par \tab The}{\b\fs24  Lasso}{\fs24  is a rope with a loop at the end; it's thrown at targe
ts, and on a successful hit the loop settles around the target. The wielder can then pull the rope taut and seriously inconvenience his target. Extensive rules for the lasso appear in }{\i\fs24 The Complete Fighter's Handbook}{\fs24 .
\par \tab The }{\b\fs24 Maul}{\fs24  is a polearm with a heavy blu
dgeoning head at the end. It is therefore a Bludgeoning weapon, and is appropriate for the use of clerics and specific priests who aren't allowed to use bladed weapons. When a priesthood allows the use of polearms, this includes the maul (and the mancatch
er, for that matter); but when maul alone is listed, the priest cannot use the other polearms.
\par \tab The }{\b\fs24 Net }{\fs24 is a weighted combat net on the end of a rope. Like the lasso, it is thrown to spread over a target; if it hits, it can be pulled closed, and the trailin
g rope used to pull the victim around. Also like the lasso, extensive rules for this weapon's use appear in }{\i\fs24 The Complete Fighter's Handbook}{\fs24 .
\par \tab The}{\b\fs24  Nunchaku}{\fs24  is an oriental weapon and only suitable for oriental-based campaigns. It consists of two wooden handl
es connected by a short chain or short length of cord. It was originally derived from an agricultural implement, which is why so many priests of nature-oriented gods can use it.
\par \tab The }{\b\fs24 Scythe }{\fs24 is a large, curving blade that is sharp only on the underside of t
he blade (the concave edge); the blade is attached to a twisted pole some 5-6' in length. The wielder uses the weapon two-handed. The scythe is a harvesting tool used by farmers to cut down their grain; as a weapon, it is symbolic of gods of agriculture, 
time, and death.

\par \tab The following material is reproduced in part from}{\i\fs24  The Complete Fighter's Handbook}{\fs24  , so that players of Fighting-Monks will have access to the rules for martial arts combat.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Attacking Without Killing}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab Before proceeding, you should familiarize yourself with the "Attacking Without Killing" rules from the}{\i\fs24  Player's Handbook}{\fs24 , pages 97-98.
\par \tab  
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Knowing Punching, Wrestling, Martial Arts
\par \tab  
\par }{\fs24 \tab As you saw in the }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook}{\fs24 , }{\i\fs24 everybody}{\fs24 
 knows how to punch and wrestle. Any character, from the doughtiest warrior to the spindliest scholar, knows hot to twist someone's arm or punch him in the jaw. (Naturally, such factors as strength, dexterity and experience level have a remarkable effect 
on how often one hits and how much damage one does.)
\par \tab Martial Arts are another matter. By "Martial Arts," we mean generic unarmed combat. This isn't karate, kung fu or tae kwan do: It's movie-style martial arts with no basis in real-world fighting styles.  
\par \tab 
A character may only know Martial Arts if the DM declares that this style is available for characters to learn. In many campaigns, it won't be. In most oriental campaigns, it will be. In campaigns where the occidental and oriental worlds have a lot of co
ntact with one another, it could easily be.
\par \tab To know Martial Arts at its basic level, the character must spend one Weapon Proficiency slot on Martial Arts. That's all it takes. Once he's spent that proficiency slot, he can use Martial Arts in the same way 
that other people use Punching and Wrestling, as we'll describe immediately below.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Martial Arts Results
\par }{\fs24 \tab  
\par \tab At its basic level, Martial Arts skill is used just like Punching and Wrestling. Martial Arts combat occurs when a character attacks with his ba
re hands, feet, and even head. No weapons are used. (A character can hold a weapon in one hand and nothing in the other, attacking with his weapon one round and with his Martial Arts skill in the next.)
\par \tab When attacking with Martial Arts skill, the characte
r makes a normal attack roll against the normal Armor Class of the target. (If the attacking character has armor on, he does suffer the "Armor Modifiers For Wrestling" from Table 57 on page 97 of the }{\i\fs24 Player's Handbook}{\fs24 
.) Any other normal modifiers are applied to the attack roll (from the attacker's Strength bonus, for example).
\par \tab If the attack roll is successful, the attacker consults the table below for the result of the attack. If, for instance, the character rolls a 13 to hit, the result is a Body-Punch, d
oing 1 point of damage (plus the character's damage bonus from Strength, if any).

\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Low Kick:}{\fs24  The attacker kicks the target in the leg or thigh.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Head Bash:}{\fs24  The attacker slams his forehead into the target's face, which is a stout maneuver.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Head Punch:}{\fs24  This is a good, strong blow with the fist to the enemy's head, particularly his jaw.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 High Kick:}{\fs24  The attacker kicks the target in the upper body somewhere: Stomach, chest, back, or shoulder.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Knee-Shot:}{\fs24  The attacker brings his knee up into the target's stomach or thigh.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Side Kick:}{\fs24  With this maneuver, the attacker has time to prepare and launch a very powerful sideways kick (which may be at the end of a cinematic leap).
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Vitals-Kick:}{\fs24  The attacker kicks his target at some vulnerable point: Groin, kidney, neck, solar plexus, etc.
\par \tab }{\b\fs24 Vitals-Punch:}{\fs24  The attacker puts his fist into one of the vulnerable points mentioned immediately above.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Specializing in Punching
\par }{\fs24 \tab  
\par \tab Any priest can specialize in Punching (or Wrestling, or Martial Arts). Of all the types of priests, though, only the Fi
ghting-Monk can specialize in more than one unarmed combat style. The DM may decide for his own campaign that Priests other than the Fighting-Monk may not specialized in any unarmed combat, or that certain types of priests (for example, of the god of peac
e) may not.
\par \tab In order to do specialize in Punching, the Priest must devote a Weapon Proficiency slot to Punching. When he does, he gets the following benefits:
\par \tab He gains a +1 bonus to all his attack rolls with Punching;
\par \tab He gains a +1 bonus to all damage with Punching; and
\par \tab He gains a +1 }{\i\fs24 chart bonus }{\fs24 with all Punching attacks.
\par \tab The chart bonus is a reflection of the character's superior accuracy with Punching. When the Fighter-Monk rolls and successfully hits, as you know, the roll itself determines which maneuver was made.
\par \tab But on a successful hit, the Punching Specialist can modify that result. If he has a }{\i\fs24 chart bonus}{\fs24  of +1, he can choose the maneuver one higher or one lower on the chart.
\par \tab  }{\i\fs24 Example: The fighter-monk Toshi punches an orc. He rolls a 18 to hit
, and this turns out to be a successful hit. On the "Punching and Wrestling Results" chart, we see that this is a Rabbit Punch. But Toshi is a Punching Specialist with a chart bonus of +1. He can choose instead for the result to be a Wild Swing (which doe
s less damage and has an inferior chance of accomplishing a knockout) or a Kidney Punch (which does the same damage but has a superior chance of accomplishing a knockout). He changes the maneuver from a Rabbit Punch to a Kidney Punch. 
\par }{\fs24 \tab Only if a character Specializes in Punching and thus has a }{\i\fs24 chart bonus}{\fs24  can he affect his punch results in this manner.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Specializing in Wrestling}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab The same rules given for Specializing in Punching also apply to Wrestling. If a Priest spends one Weapon Proficiency slot on Wrestling, he is a Wrestling Specialist:
\par \tab He gains a +1 bonus to all his attack rolls with Wrestling;
\par \tab He gains a +1 bonus to all damage with Wrestling (that is, all his maneuvers will do 2 points of damage plus his Strength bonus, and continued holds cause cumulatively 1 more point of damage for each round they are held); and
\par \tab He gains a +1 chart bonus with all Wrestling attacks.
\par \tab So if, for instance, he rolls a 9 to hit, and that hits, his result would normally be a Leg lock. If he chooses, he can change it to an Elbow smash or a Headlock.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Specializing in Martial Arts
\par }{\fs24 \tab  
\par \tab The same rules given for Specializing in Punching and Wrestling also apply to Martial Arts, with one exception. No character knows Martial Arts automatically. Therefore, the charact
er must first spend one Weapon Proficiency slot to know Martial Arts in the first place, and then must spend one more to become a Martial Arts Specialist.
\par \tab As usual, when the character becomes a Martial Arts Specialist:
\par \tab He gains a +1 bonus to all his attack rolls with Martial Arts;
\par \tab He gains a +1 bonus to all damage with Martial Arts; and
\par \tab He gains a +1 chart bonus with all Martial Arts attacks.
\par \tab So if he rolls a 15 to hit, and the attack 
hits, he has performed a Side Kick. If he uses his +1 chart bonus, he can change that into an Elbow Shot or a Head Bash. He'll probably choose to change it to a Head Bash, for the improved damage and improved chance of KO.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 More Than One Style}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab Only a Fighting-Monk can specialize in more than one unarmed combat style. A Fighting-Monk can only specialize in one of the three unarmed combat styles when he is first created. After first level, however, he may specialize in the other two.
\par \tab As described in the writeup of the Fighting-Monk kit, the character can save some of his Weapon Proficiencies.
\par \tab For example, at first level, he could specialize in Martial Arts, then spend another slot at second level to specialize in Wrestling, then another at third level to specialize in Punching.
\par \tab However, if he first specializes in Punching or Wrestling, he cannot specialize in Martial Arts at the next experience level. He can only spend one slot per experience level, meaning that he'll first gain proficiency with Marti
al Arts at one level, then specialize at the next level.
\par \tab Usually, the character, if he wants to specialize in more than one style, will take either Martial Arts or Punching, not both, and then take Wrestling. Martial Arts and Punching overlap one another 
somewhat, but Wrestling is useful when the character is being held.
\par \tab   
\par }{\b\fs24\cf2 Continuing Specialization}{\fs24 
\par \tab  
\par \tab This is an option only for Fighting-Monks (and Warrior characters); other Priests }{\i\fs24 may not do this.
\par }{\fs24 \tab If a Fighting-Monk continues to devote Weapon Proficiency slots to an unarmed combat style }{\i\fs24 after he is already specializing in it}{\fs24 , he gets the following benefits.
\par \tab For each additional slot devoted to his art, as before:
\par \tab He gains a +1 bonus to all his attack rolls with his combat style;
\par \tab He gains a +1 bonus to all damage with his combat style; and
\par \tab He gains a +1 chart bonus with all attacks in that combat style. With chart bonuses of +2 or more, the character can choose any maneuver within the range of maneuvers covered by his chart bonus (see the example below).
\par \tab A Fighting-Monk, once he has specialized in a fighting style, can only devote one Weapon Proficiency slot to that style }{\i\fs24 per experience level}{\fs24 
. Therefore, a first-level Fighting-Monk could specialize in Martial Arts by devoting two slots to it. He could not devote another slot to it until second level, and then could not devote another slot until third level, and so on.
\par \tab Let's use that character as an example.
\par \tab }{\i\fs24 Example: Toshi the Fighting-Monk specializes in Martial Arts at first level, adds one proficiency slot to it at second level, and another at third level. 
\par \tab At third level, he has a +3 bonus to attack rolls with Martial Arts, a +3 to damage rolls with Martial Arts, and a +3 chart bonus. 
\par \tab Let's say he rolls a 17 to hit someone, and that the attack d
oes hit. This would normally be a Vitals-Punch. But he has a +3 chart bonus. He can choose for the maneuver to be a Head Punch, a High Kick, a Vitals-Kick, the Vitals-Punch that was rolled, a Head Bash, a Side Kick, or an Elbow Shot. Assuming that he take
s the punishing Head Punch, he'll do 3 points for the maneuver, +3 points from the damage bonus he gets for specializing, and any bonus his Strength grants him. }{\fs24 
\par                                                               *     *     *\tab 
\par \tab \tab That, in brief, is the way Martial Arts works for the fighting-monk. You are encouraged to read the Combat chapter of }{\i\fs24 The Complete Fighter's Handbook}{\fs24  for more rules and guidelines on the use of unarmed combat in the game.
